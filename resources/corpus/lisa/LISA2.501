CONCERNED, BULGARIA LIES IN THE 7TH AND 4TH PLACES RESPECTIVELY IN THE WORLD.

CURRENT BOOK COLLECTIONS. THUS, HIGHER EFFICIENCY REQUIRED IN ALL FIELDS OF
THE NATION'S LIFE BY THE RECENT 12TH CONGRESS OF THE BULGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTY
MUST ALSO BE AIMED FOR IN LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES. GREAT ATTENTION
MUST BE PAID IN PARTICULAR TO SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER SPECIAL LIBRARIES WHICH
NEED TO COPE NOT ONLY WITH THE PRESENT INFORMATION EXPLOSION, BUT ALSO WITH
SOARING PRICES OF WESTERN PUBLICATIONS AND BULGARIA'S LIMITED FOREIGN CURRENCY
RESOURCES. AMONGST OTHER PROBLEMS ARE THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF
LIBRARIANS, THE NEEDS IN NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS, MECHANISATION, AUTOMATION, AND
UPDATING OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, NOT
ONLY AS KEEPER OF THE NATIONAL LITERARY HERITAGE, BUT ALSO AS THE MOST
IMPORTANT LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY, IS, IN ITSELF,
A SPECIAL CASE. IT SHOULD BE RELIEVED OF SOME OF ITS PROBLEMS ON THE OCCASION

WHEN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL WANTS TO ALTER ITS ROAD-MAP.
     
REACTIONS OF LIBRARIANS TO RECENT PROPOSALS (TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE 1976-77
REPORTS ON POSSIBLE ELEVATION TO UNIVERSITY STATUS) FOR A NEW CURRICULUM IN
THE NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL. POINTS COVERED INCLUDE THE PROPOSED 2-YEAR
COMMON COURSE, WITH SPECIALISATION IN THE 3RD YEAR (GENERALLY APPROVED);
METHODS SUBJECTS (BIBLIOGRAPHY IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY, BUT SOME CONSIDER
COMPUTER STUDIES NOWADAYS EQUALLY ESSENTIAL); LITERATURE AND SOCIETY (THOUGHT
TO MERIT MORE ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, POPULAR LITERATURE,
AND SERVICES TO HANDICAPPED AND IMMIGRANTS); INFORMATION SCIENCE (SHOULD BE
INCLUDED IN 2 OR EVEN 3 YEARS); ADMINISTRATION (CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY
ESSENTIAL); PRACTICAL TRAINING (SHOULD PROBABLY BE EXTENDED); EVALUATION OF
STUDENTS' WORK (GENERAL OPINION FAVOURS THE RETENTION OF MARKING TOGETHER WITH
CONTINUOUS EVALUATION); LECTURING STAFF (LIBRARY EXPERIENCE IS PREFERRED TO
ACADEMIC SPECIALISATION); INTAKE OF STUD ENTS (AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SHOULD COVER
THE WHOLE COUNTRY). BETTER LIAISON ON EDUCATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND LIBRARY
PROFESSION IS FELT DESIRABLE, BUT THERE SEEMS NO MAJOR DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN

THIS ONE-SIDED PRAXIS-WORSHIP.
     
A NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL STUDENT REBUTS 3 CLAIMS MADE BY PREVIOUS
WRITERS (SPECIAL SECTION ON LIBRARY EDUCATION IN NORWAY, 2IBID1 46 (8) 1979;
2SEE1 81/60)' (1) THAT LECTURERS HAVE TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL LIBRARY EXPERIENCE
(&H HAVE EXTENSIVE LIBRARY EXPERIENCE, WHILE THE OTHERS MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH
CURRENT LIBRARY PRACTICE); (2) THAT THE COURSE CONTAINS TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL
TRAINING (THE NEW 3-YEAR THEORETICAL CURRICULUM IS A STEP FORWARD. INTERNAL
AND EXTERNAL PRACTICAL WORK, THOUGH STILL NECESSARY, ARE OF LIMITED VALUE IN A
CONSTANTLY DEVELOPING NATIONAL LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE SCHOOL'S PRIMARY TASK IS TO
EDUCATE INDEPENDENT, CRITICAL LIBRARIANS WHO CAN EVALUATE THEIR ROLE IN A
SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE AND BE OPEN TO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE); AND (3) THAT
INSTRUCTION IS TOO THEORETICAL (ON THE CONTRARY, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO
OVER-VALUE DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK, VIEWING LIBRARIANSHIP AS A SERVICE
INDUSTRY RATHER THAN A SCHOLARLY DISCIPLINE). A MORE LIBRARY /SOCIOLOGICAL-
AND PROJECT-ORIENTED CURRICULUM IS NEEDED, CALLING FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF
COMMITMENT FROM BOTH STUDENTS AND LECTURERS.

NATIONAL LIBRARIAN. DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE NOT GIVEN THE SUPPORT FROM

FEARS THAT THE PROPOSED LIBRARY ACT, FAR FROM CREATING UNITY WITHIN THE DANISH
LIBRARY SERVICE, WOULD EMPHASISE THE DIVISION BETWEEN RESEARCH LIBRARIES UNDER
THE CULTURAL MINISTRY AND THOSE UNDER THE EDUCATION MINISTRY. HE HOPED THAT
THE CULTURAL MINISTER WOULD NOT BE UNDULY INFLUENCED BY THE DANISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WHEN FORMULATING THE LIBRARY ACT RELATED TO RESEARCH LIBRARIES.
INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THEM FOR LACK OF OPENNESS TO THE PUBLIC THE MINISTER
SHOULD SEE THAT ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE REMOVED.

REGRETTABLE. LIBRARIES SHOULD DEFINE THEIR USERS MORE BROADLY, NOW THAT THE
EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE POPULATION HAS RISEN AND USERS NEED MATERIAL AT ALL

USE OF THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN LIBRARIES IS A QUESTION OF THE
SURVIVAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC LIBRARY, IT CAN REVOLUTIONISE RURAL LIFE AN D
EDUCATION. IT IS SOCIETY THROUGH ITS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS WHICH MUST DECIDE

PROFILE OF A PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
THE 5-YEARLY 2CENSUS OF LIBRARIES1, PUBLISHED BY THE NEW ZEALAND DEPARTMENT OF
STATISTICS, PROVIDES SO MUCH QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON THE COUNTRY'S
LIBRARIES THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DIGEST AND INTERPRET. USING THE
1974 ISSUE (THE MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED), SETS OUT A METHOD OF PRODUCING A
PROFILE (IN THE FORMAT OF A GRAPH) OF A PUBLIC LIBRARY, BASED ON 5 FACTORS
(POPULATION SERVED, TOTAL BOOK-STOCK, CIRCULATION, NUMBER OF FULL-TIME STAFF,
AND OPERATING EXPENDITURE). THIS PROFILE ENABLES COMPARISONS TO BE MADE OF THE
RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF SIMILAR LIBRARIES.

IF CONFIDENCE VANISHES IN THE FUTURE' STATE LIBRARY CENTRE, WHITHER GOEST
THOU?.
     
MOST STATE LIBRARY CENTRES, EXCEPT THOSE IN BAVARIA, NOW HAVE TO FACE
FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS, JUST AT A TIME WHEN INCREASES IN STOCKS AND SERVICES
ARE BADLY NEEDED. EVERYTHING THAT LIBRARY CENTRES HOPED FOR SEEMS THREATENED.
THE GERMAN TENDENCY TOWARDS PERFECTION APPLIES TO MEDIUM-SIZED RATHER THAN TO
SMALL ORGANISATIONS. THE INCREASED USE OF NON-BOOK MEDIA HAS CHANGED THE
CENTRES' ROLE. THE CENTRES HAVE PLAYED AN INVALUABLE PART IN DEVELOPING RURAL
LIBRARY SERVICES BUT THEIR GOLDEN AGE IS NOW PAST. LIBRARY POLICY COULD BE
ALTERED, HOWEVER, THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CENTRES' TASKS BY REGIONAL
LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. THESE ASSOCIATIONS SHOULD BE FORMED IN AREAS WHERE NONE
EXIST; BASED ON A CONSTITUTION WORKED OUT BY LOCAL POLITICIANS, THEY CAN WORK
TOWARDS IMPROVING SERVICE QUALITY.

AVOIDING THE WORST' THE 29TH CONFERENCE OF THE STATE LIBRARY CENTRES IN
BURGHAUSEN.
     
REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE HELD IN SEPT/OCT 81, WITH A CENTRAL THEME OF
LITERATURE PROVISION FOR RURAL AREAS. SUBJECTS COVERED INCLUDED' THE
FORESEEABLE AND UNFORESEEABLE ASPECTS OF LIBRARY PLANNING; THE TASKS AND
FUNCTIONS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SPATIAL PLANNING; AND
LITERATURE PROVISION WITHIN RURAL CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. WARNINGS WERE GIVEN
AGAINST EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS PROVIDED WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE AND
AGAINST RESIGNATION IN THE FACE OF DIFFICULTIES. A BROADLY BASED,
DECENTRALISED LENDING SYSTEM SHOULD CATER FOR BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIALISED
REQUIREMENTS. THE STATE SHOULD SUPPORT AND COMPLEMENT LOCAL LIBRARY SERVICES
BUT REFRAIN FROM EXCESSIVE INTERFERENCE IN THEM. BAVARIA IS THE STATE THAT HAS
MADE MOST PROGRESS IN THIS DIRECTION; ITS STATE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME REFLECTS
THE IMPORTANCE OF SYSTEMATIC PLANNING.

J. PETERSEN: 'THE READING HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES IN THE FUTURE': HIGHER

THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED': THIS IS THE MOST NEGLECTED GROUP; THE POLICY OF

PEOPLE IN THE USA. CHANGES IN THE LAWS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE MAKING OF ALL
PUBLIC BUILDINGS ACCESSIBLE TO THE HANDICAPPED. THIS HAS LED TO NEW STANDARDS
FOR BUILDING AND THE RENOVATION OF OLD BUILDINGS SOME OF WHICH HAVE REQUIRED
CONSIDERABLE WORK. THE NEW LAWS HAVE CAUSED CONTROVERSY IN SMALL TOWNS WITH
FEW, IF ANY, HANDICAPPED PEOPLE OVER WHO SHOULD PAY FOR RENOVATION WORK.

TURKISH CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS AS LIBRARY USERS.
     
LIBRARIANS KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE VIEWS OF FOREIGN WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES
ON LIBRARIES; MANY OF THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND LITTLE GERMAN. IN JULY 80 MUNICH
MUNICIPAL LIBRARY PRODUCED A QUESTIONNAIRE FOR TURKISH CHILDREN, INCLUDING
QUESTIONS ON AGE, SEX, SCHOOLS AND TYPES OF CLASS, LENGTH OF TIME IN GERMANY,
ABILITY TO READ GERMAN, LIBRARY USE AND LIKES AND DISLIKES CONCERNING BOOKS,
CASSETTES AND LIBRARY FACILITIES. LANGUAGE PROBLEMS LED TO SOME
MISUNDERSTANDINGS; THE DESIGN OF FUTURE QUESTIONNAIRES MUST BE IMPROVED.
RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE AVERAGE READER IS 10-13 YEARS OLD, MALE, IN A TURKISH
CLASS AT SCHOOL AND CAN READ SOME GERMAN BOOKS. HE CAME TO GERMANY WITHIN THE
LAST 4 YEARS, LEARNT ABOUT THE LIBRARY FROM FRIENDS, HAS A READER'S TICKET AND

FEAR OF TALKING' WHICH STUDENTS IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY ASK LIBRARIANS FOR
HELP?.
     
FOR MANY LIBRARY USERS, THE LIBRARIAN IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ANY SEARCH
STRATEGY. AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS
OF 1 COMMUNICATION VARIABLE, COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION (CA), THE FEAR OF
TALKING, ON THE USER'S DECISION TO SEARCH A LIBRARY INDEPENDENTLY OR WITH THE
LIBRARIAN'S ASSISTANCE. IT WAS FOUND THAT RESPONDENTS, REGARDLESS OF CA LEVEL,
BEHAVED SIMILARLY IN SEARCHING A LIBRARY WHEN MEASURED IN TERMS OF INITIAL
STEP, NUMBER OF STEPS, AND LENGTH OF SEARCH TIME. CA WAS ELIMINATED AS A
VARIABLE INFLUENCING THE INITIATION OF AN INTERACTION WITH A LIBRARIAN.
FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE ITS POSSIBLE EFFECTS ONCE THAT
INTERACTION HAS BEGUN.

MAPS WERE PRINTED AND PUBLISHED MAINLY IN AMSTERDAM, ROME, AUSBURG AND
NUERBURG, BULGARIA'S OWN CARTOGRAPHIC FACILITIES STARTED WITH THE FIRST MAP
PRODUCED BY A BULGARIAN IN BULGARIAN WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1843. EVEN THEN,

FROM TURKISH RULE (1878), FOLLOWED BY THE FOUNDATION OF VARIOUS NATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS, HEADED BY THE STATE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE (1891) AND
THE UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA (1898) WITH THE CHAIR OF GEOGRAPHY . THERE WERE ALSO

PAPER GIVEN AT THE SWEDISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING. DESCRIBES
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE VIDEO FIELD, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO AN
ABUNDANCE OF PICTURES COMPETING ON OUR TV SCREENS. THIS SITUATION HAS BOTH
PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES. THE OUTPUT OF VIDEO CASSETTES CONSISTS MAINLY OF
LOW QUALITY ACTION FILMS AND THE DELAY IN THE PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF
SWEDISH TV PROGRAMMES, WHICH SHOULD HEIGHTEN THE QUALITY, IS REGRETTABLE. BUT
THE NEW DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALSO OFFERS NEW FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND INDEPENDENCE
OF TRANSMISSION TIMES. VIDEO TECHNIQUES ARE USEFUL FOR MINORITIES SUCH AS THE
DEAF AND IMMIGRANTS. THE VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION THEREFORE RECOMMENDS THAT
LIBRARIES SHOULD SHOW VIDEO FILMS, LEND THEM AND TRANSMIT THEM VIA CABLE.

VIDEO IS A MATERIAL WHICH PROPERLY BELONGS IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY AND CAN BE
ACQUIRED WITH PUBLIC MONEY. THE DESIRABILITY OF HAVING RADIO AND TV PROGRAMMES
AVAILABLE FOR LOAN IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS OFTEN BEEN POINTED OUT, BUT THIS
WOULD NECESSITATE CHANGES IN THE COPYRIGHT ACT OR DIRECT NEGOTIATION BY THE
LIBRARIES WITH THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS. ARCHIVES FOR RADIO AND TV PRODUCTIONS

DEICHMAN LIBRARY AND SERIES BOOKS FOR CHILDREN.
     
IN SPRING 79 DEICHMAN LIBRARY, OSLO, STOPPED BUYING CHILDREN'S SERIES BOOKS
AND DISCARDED WORN-OUT STOCK COPIES. THEY WERE SURPRISED BY HOSTILE PUBLIC
REACTION (A SELECTION OF READERS' LETTERS TO OSLO NEWSPAPERS IS APPENDED),
HAVING REGARDED THE MOVE AS CORRECTING A LONG-STANDING MISTAKE. SINCE THE
MID-60S DEICHMAN HAD BOUGHT A FEW COPIES OF 2HARDY BOYS1 AND SIMILAR TITLES,
RECOGNISED AS SUB-STANDARD LITERATURE, BUT INTENDED TO LEAD CHILDREN TO BETTER
BOOKS AND INCREASE THE THEN INADEQUATE SELECTION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. BY
1979 THE STANDARD OF NORWEGIAN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAD GREATLY IMPROVED AND
THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE TITLES INCREASED. IN VIEW OF RISING BOOK PRICES,
PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO GOOD NORWEGIAN CHILDREN'S BOOKS RATHER THAN ADULT AND
FOREIGN BOOKS IN CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTS (EXCEPTING BOOKS FOR IMMIGRANTS).
SERIES BOOKS WERE EXCLUDED FOR A YEAR AS AN EXPERIMENT.

THE ADMINISTRATION OF A SMALLER PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITY AND THE ORGANISATION

IN THE NETHERLANDS LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH LESS THAN 30,000 INHABITANTS MAY
ORGANISE THEIR OWN LIBRARY SERVICE. HOWEVER, THEY ARE REQUIRED BY THE DUTCH
PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT TO WORK IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE COUNTY LIBRARY
NETWORK. LIBRARY COMMITTEES IN THESE AREAS SHOULD INCLUDE A REPRESENTATIVE
CROSS-SECTION OF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY. COMMITTEE
MEMBERS WITH LOCAL CONNECTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THE AREA. HOWEVER, WHERE THE LOCAL LIBRARY COMMITTEE INSISTS ON FOLLOWING
ITS OWN POLICIES, THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM MAY BE PREVENTED FROM PURSUING A
COORDINATED POLICY FOR ALL LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT ITS REGION. THE INTERESTS OF
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN BE SERVED BY THE CREATION OF LIBRARY USERS' COMMITTEES

LITTLE PUBLICITY EITHER IN THE NATIONAL, LOCAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRESS. ACTIONS
BY USER GROUPS, ESPECIALLY IF THESE ARE GENERALLY RESPECTED CITIZENS, CAN BE
VERY EFFECTIVE AND CONTACT WITH ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

LIBRARY SERVICE DEVOLVES ENTIRELY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE NORWEGIAN PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEM WILL BE THREATENED BY DISINTEGRATION, WITH NATIONAL LIBRARY
DUTIES CONCENTRATED IN A FEW STATE-OWNED SPECIAL LIBRARIES. SINCE EVEN THE
REVISED LIBRARY ACT OF 1971 DID NOT OBLIGE COUNTIES TO OPERATE A LIBRARY
SERVICE, THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND DEVELOPED LARGELY THROUGH THE
INFLUENCE AND SUPPORT OF CENTRAL AUTHORITY. THE BASIS FOR THE 1971 ACT WAS THE

THE DEBATE ON COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES CENTRES AROUND 2 QUESTIONS' WHETHER
COMPUTERS ON THE WHOLE ARE OF BENEFIT TO USERS, AND WHETHER THE BUMS SYSTEM IN
PARTICULAR IS OF VALUE. INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERS MEANS THAT LIBRARY STAFF

DEHUMANISED, AND READERS USE MACHINES DIRECTLY WITH MINIMAL HELP FROM STAFF.
SOME SKILLS ARE LOST AND REPLACED WITH ROUTINES. AS FOR THE BUMS SYSTEM, SOME
ROUTINES HAVE MERELY REPLACED OTHERS. A TRADITIONAL CARD CATALOGUE IS EASIER
TO USE THAN THE BUMS CATALOGUE, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER MAKES SURVEY OF THE
LIBRARY'S TOTAL STOCK POSSIBLE. BUT THIS LEADS IN TURN TO INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF REQUESTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM; IT FAVOURS THE ACTIVE,
EXPERIENCED USERS, BUT DISCOURAGES THE INEXPERIENCED AND THE BROWSERS. THE

THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS PROMOTER OF TECHNO-FASCISM' THE (ANTI-)SOCIAL
CONSEQUENCES OF AUTOMATION.
     
MODERN SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, INSUFFICIENT
ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATION. THE
PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE NETHERLANDS HAVE UNDERTAKEN
NO STUDIES OF THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS ON THEIR MEMBERS' BEHALF APART FROM THE
NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND
LITERATURE), WHICH IN 1979 FORMED A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE WAYS OF
PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST THE MISUSE OF PERSONAL
INFORMATION IN COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE
COMMITTEE WERE REJECTED IN 1980 BY NBLC MEMBERS AS TOO RADICAL. AUTOMATION
WILL LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF POSTS IN LIBRARIES AT ALL LEVELS AND
LIBRARIANS MUST ACT NOW TO PREVENT A FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE SITUATION.

MINICOMPUTERS AND AVAILABLE PACKAGES.
     
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMPUTER FIELD IN RECENT YEARS ARE DESCRIBED WITH
PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR THE MECHANISATION OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION TASKS. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MINICOMPUTERS A NEW ERA
OPENED UP FOR INFORMATION WORKERS BUT A MAJOR PROBLEM HAD TO BE OVERCOME,
NAMELY THE LACK OF SUITABLE SOFTWARE TO PROVIDE THOSE FACILITIES. FOLLOWING
THE INTRODUCTION OF IBM'S STAIRS PROGRAM FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL
ON A LARGE MAINFRAME COMPUTER, SIMILAR PROGRAMS SOON BECAME AVAILABLE FOR USE
ON THE RANGE OF MINICOMPUTERS WHICH HAD STARTED TO PENETRATE THE MARKET. MANY
WERE SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION USE; DISCUSSES CAIRS
AND STATUS. A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH CAME WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF WORD
PROCESSORS, PARTICULARLY THE PROGRAMMABLE SHARED LOGIC SYSTEMS. MANUFACTURERS
STARTED TO PRODUCE SPECIFIC SOFTWARE PACKAGES, INCLUDING INFORMATION STORAGE
AND RETRIEVAL PROGRAMS, FOR THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT. EXAMPLES OF RELEVANT

APPLICATION OF SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY TO LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE 1ST AND FOREMOST TASK OF LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA IS TO EDUCATE THEIR
READERS AND TO EXERCISE INFLUENCE ON THEIR READING HABITS. TO BE CAPABLE OF
PERFORMING THE JOB SUCCESSFULLY, LIBRARIANS MUST ACQUIRE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE
OF SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY. THUS, THEY WILL NOT ONLY SEE EACH
READER AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH HIS/HER OWN FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND,
PERSONAL QUALITIES, AND PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS, BUT THEY WILL ALSO BE ABLE
TO MAKE THE BEST OF A LEADER'S AUTHORITY IN A GROUP. EDUCATION OF CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS HAS BENEFITTED FROM COLLABORATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS
AND THE EXPERIENCE GAINED MUST NOW BE USED MORE FULLY IN ADULT EDUCATION. ON

SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION STRATEGY OF CHINOIN.
     
IN HUNGARY, PHARMACEUTICAL WORKS DEVOTE MUCH OF THEIR INCOME TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW COMPOUNDS. PATENTS MAY ONLY BE ISSUED FOR NEW MATERIALS AND
METHODS, SO INFORMATION ON PATENTS AND SPECIAL LITERATURE MUST BE UP TO DATE.
FOR THIS THE CHINOIN TECHNICAL LIBRARY USES CLASSIC AND MODERN COMPUTERISED
SERVICES. THE LIBRARY SUBSCRIBES TO ONLY 212 JOURNALS, BUT USES DERWENT MANUAL
CARD AND ABSTRACTING SERVICES, AND THE 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1 SEARCH SYSTEM.
RETROSPECTIVE SEARCHING IS CARRIED OUT MANUALLY THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE,
2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1. IT IS PROPOSED TO COOPERATE DIRECTLY WITH THE COMPUTER
STATION AT THE OFFICE FOR SYSTEM ANALYSIS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DATA BANK, INCLUDING NEW

POSSIBILITIES OF LITERATURE SUPPLY FOR THE TRAINING OF PHARMACISTS.
     
WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE ON LITERATURE USAGE, UNIVERSITY-ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE WILL
GRADUALLY VANISH. SINCE THESIS PRESENTATION AT A FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY IS
ONLY NECESSARY FOR A PHD, TASKS MUST BE ASSIGNED WHICH REQUIRE A CERTAIN
EXPERTISE IN SPECIAL LITERATURE. 1 OR 2 SESSIONS ARE INADEQUATE TO TEACH THESE
SKILLS, AND LECTURES CAN ONLY BE INFLUENTIAL IF A GOOD LIBRARY IS AVAILABLE TO
STUDENTS. THE FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY AT SZEGED HAS AN EXCELLENT LIBRARY,
WHEREAS THE BUDAPEST FACULTY HAS NO REAL, UP-TO-DATE LIBRARY. A SOLUTION IS
EXPECTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

JOURNALS IN LIBRARIES.
     
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH JOURNAL COLLECTIONS IN
LIBRARIES. COLLECTIONS WERE OFTEN INCOMPLETE, UNSUITABLY STORED AND OFTEN
IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE OWING TO INCOMPLETE CATALOGUING. 1 IMPROVEMENT WAS THE
INTRODUCTION OF MICROFILM WHICH WAS EASIER TO STORE AND MEANT THAT ORIGINAL
JOURNAL COPIES COULD BE STORED IN THE ARCHIVES AND NOT DAMAGED BY CONTINUAL
USE. THE ASSOCIATION OF GERMAN LIBRARIANS' COMMISSION FOR JOURNALS HAS
PUBLISHED IMPORTANT MATERIAL DEALING WITH THE BEST WAYS OF STORING AND
CATALOGUING JOURNAL COLLECTIONS AND COOPERATIVE FILMING WITH OTHER LIBRARIES.
AN IMPORTANT AID TO LOCATING JOURNALS IS GERD HAGELWEIDE'S LOCATION CATALOGUE
DEUTSCHE ZEITUNGSBESTANDE IN BIBLIOTHEKEN UND ARCHIVEN (GERMAN JOURNAL
COLLECTIONS IN LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES). THE PUBLICATION OF REGIONAL JOURNAL

A PLANNED DECENTRALIZED SOLUTION FOR NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY' THE FEDERAL
REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.
     
EDITED VERSION OF PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL
DOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22-24 SEPT 80. SUPRAREGIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY
IS DECENTRALISED IN WEST GERMANY BECAUSE THE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK IS FEDERAL.

FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT, WHICH ORGANISES AND LARGELY FUNDS A COOPERATIVE
PROGRAMME BASED ON SPECIAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES
(SONDERSAMMELGEBIETSBIBLIOTHEKEN). THE 7 REGIONAL UNION CATALOGUES HAVE BEEN
SUPPLEMENTED BY CENTRAL SUBJECT CATALOGUES, THE BERLIN PERIODICALS DATA BASE,
AND OTHER UNION CATALOGUING PROJECTS. INTERLENDING IS BASED ON THE 7 REGIONS,
BUT DIRECT REQUESTING TO THE SPECIAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES HAS INCREASED
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SEARCH FOR FASTER SUPPLY TIMES.

CONSERVATION IN THE LIBRARY.
     
DURING RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING CONCERN OVER THE PHYSICAL
CONDITION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS. PAPER IS BRITTLE AND CRUMBLING, BINDINGS ARE
DISINTEGRATING, PRINT IS FADING AND COVERS ARE SOFT AND SPONGY. UNFORTUNATELY
RESTORATION IS EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING. DISCUSSES THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCES
IN THE LIBRARY AND THE MANY AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT AND CONTROL THE

THE CONSERVATION OF THE FRENCH DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE.
     
AMONG THE MANY EXPRESSIONS OF THE PAST BROUGHT TO LIGHT DURING HERITAGE YEAR
IN FRANCE (1980), THE BOOK, IN MANUSCRIPT AND PRINT FORMS, IN PUBLIC OR
PRIVATE COLLECTIONS, OUGHT TO BE PROTECTED BY A NATIONAL CONSERVATION POLICY.
ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF PARTIAL INVENTORIES EXIST, SUCH A POLICY CANNOT BE
MAINTAINED AT PRESENT IN FRANCE WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF A GENERAL INVENTORY.
APART FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, WHICH HAS SPECIALISED RESTORATION FACILITIES
AND A DEPARTMENT FOR THE PREVENTION AND DETECTION OF DAMAGED DOCUMENTS,
LIBRARIES RARELY HAVE THE MEANS TO ASSURE THE MATERIAL PROTECTION OF
DOCUMENTS. THE PROTECTION OF THE NATIONAL HERITAGE SHOULD EXTEND TO THE
SELECTION OF 20TH CENTURY DOCUMENTS.

MODEL TO ASSIST 72 PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES IN COMPARING THE COST OF
ALTERNATIVE FUTURE FORMS OF CATALOGUE, EMPHASISING THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING
AACR2. 68 LIBRARIES PREPARED INPUTS CHARACTERISING THEIR COSTS AND MODES OF
OPERATION, AND THESE WERE USED, WITH THE MODEL, TO COMPUTE COSTS OF
ALTERNATIVE CATALOGUE FORMS. INPUTS AND OUTPUTS OF THE MODEL WERE HIGHLY
VARIABLE. COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING AACR2 WERE ESTIMATED TO BE 4-7% OF THE TOTAL
COST OF DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING A CATALOGUE. THE MODEL CAN BE A USEFUL

SAYS EVERYTHING WHICH CAN BE SAID ABOUT LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION IT IS
CONSIDERED THAT IT SHOULD NOT NOW BE FORGOTTEN. HOWEVER THE FAILURE TO RELATE
THE THEORY IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE SUBJECTS
WITHIN THE SCHEDULES SET THE UNFORTUNATE PATTERN BY WHICH LIBRARY
CLASSIFICATION CAME TO BE DISCUSSED WITH LITTLE OR NO REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER INVOLVED. THE FACT THAT DEWEY SURVIVES AS THE MOST WIDELY USED

DATA-TAGGING EXPERIMENT FOR ENERGY-RELATED DOCUMENTS AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS
SERVICE.
     
AN EXPERIMENT IS DESCRIBED THAT EVALUATED THE USEFULNESS AND ECONOMIC
FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING DATA TAGS INTO SECONDARY INFORMATION FILES. TAGS
ARE BRIEF CODES THAT INDICATE THE PRESENCE IN A PRIMARY DOCUMENT OF SPECIFIC
TYPES OF NUMERICAL DATA. TAGS WERE SELECTED IN COOPERATION WITH USERS OF THE
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S (DOE) RECON SYSTEM AND ADDED TO A SPECIAL VERSION
OF THE COMPUTER-READABLE ENERGY FILE. RECON USERS ASSISTED IN AN EVALUATION OF
THE TAGGING PROCESS. IT WAS FOUND THAT DATA TAGS DO INCREASE ACCESS TO
NUMERICAL DATA IN THE PRIMARY LITERATURE, BUT A FILE SPANNING SEVERAL YEARS IS
NECESSARY TO PRODUCE USEFUL RESULTS. EVALUATION OF PROCESSING COSTS REVEALED
THAT AFTER THE INITIAL TRAINING PERIOD, COSTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER
FOR THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF DATA TAGS EMPLOYED IN THIS STUDY. THE FEASIBILITY
OF INCLUDING DATA TAGS IN NONENERGY SECTIONS OF 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS 1WAS
EXAMIN ED WITH PRIMARY EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC AND EDITORIAL FACTORS. IT WAS
SHOWN THAT SUBJECT CONTENT GOVERNS THE SELECTION OF DATA TYPES TO BE TAGGED
FOR A SECTION OR GROUP OF RELATED SECTIONS WITH THE OVERRIDING CONSIDERATION

THESE COMPARISONS, SPECIFICALLY THOSE BETWEEN DOCUMENTS HAVING NO TERMS IN
COMMON, MAY BE AVOIDED BY MEANS OF THE USE OF AN INVERTED FILE TO THE DOCUMENT
COLLECTION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE APPROACH WILL EFFECT REDUCTIONS IN THE NUMBER
OF INTERDOCUMENT COMPARISONS ONLY IF THE DOCUMENTS ARE EACH INDEXED BY A
LIMITED NUMBER OF INDEXING TERMS; IF EXHAUSTIVE INDEXING IS USED, MANY
DOCUMENT PAIRS WILL BE COMPARED SEVERAL TIMES OVER AND THE COMPUTATION WILL BE

DESPITE THE VAST MARKET IN MICROCOMPUTERS, THERE ARE STILL MANY RESTRICTIONS
WHICH MAY PREVENT THEIR BEING USED IN SOME APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THE CAPACITY
OF THE PRIMARY MEMORY. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE VERY FEW STANDARDS IN THE AREA
OF MICROCOMPUTERS, LEADING TO PROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY BOTH FROM THE HARDWARE

PERFORMANCE TESTING OF A BOOK AND ITS INDEX AS AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
THE RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE OF BOOK INDEXES CAN BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF THEIR
ABILITY TO DIRECT A USER SELECTIVELY TO TEXT MATERIAL WHOSE IDENTITY BUT NOT
LOCATION IS KNOWN. THE METHOD REQUIRES HUMAN SEARCHERS TO BASE THEIR SEARCHING
STRATEGIES ON ACTUAL PASSAGES FROM THE BOOK RATHER THAN ON TEST QUERIES,
NATURAL OR CONTRIVED. IT CIRCUMVENTS THE NEED FOR RELEVANCE JUDGMENT, BUT
STILL YIELDS PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT CORRESPOND APPROXIMATELY TO THE
RECALL AND PRECISION RATIOS OF LARGE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM EVALUATION.

COMPUTER ASSISTANCE IN INDEXING WITH INDEX.
     
DESCRIBES THE COMPILATION OF INDEXES TO 2 BOOKS USING THE PROGRAM INDEX ON THE
MTS (MICHIGAN TERMINAL SYSTEM) OPERATING THE IBM 378/3033 COMPUTER. DISCUSSES
THE ADVANTAGES OF COMPUTER INDEXING, WHICH INCLUDE' SPEED IN PREPARATION;
ACCURACY IN TRANSCRIPTION; AND EASE OF TRANSMISSION FROM 1 LOCATION TO
ANOTHER. CONCLUDES, HOWEVER, THAT IT IS AN AID RATHER THAN A COMPETITOR TO
INDEXES, SINCE AN INDEXER MUST STILL MAKE DECISIONS AS TO CROSS REFERENCING,
SUBHEADS, AND CATEGORIES.

JUSTICE OF COMPENSATING AN AUTHOR WHEN HIS BOOKS ARE USED; THE USE OF PLR TO
ENCOURAGE NATIVE AUTHORS; PLR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA; INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS;

POINTS OF VIEW OF LIBRARIANS' ALTERNATIVES TO PLR.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). LISTS THE
MAJOR POINTS OF LIBRARIAN OPPOSITION TO PLR, FOCUSING ON THE QUESTIONS' DO
AUTHORS HAVE NATURAL PROPRIETARY RIGHTS CONCERNING THEIR TEXTS; ARE LIBRARIES
INFRINGING THESE RIGHTS; DO AUTHORS SUFFER FINANCIAL DAMAGE THROUGH LIBRARY
CIRCULATION; WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF PLR ON LIBRARIES; AND WHO WILL REALLY
BENEFIT FROM PLR. LIBRARIANS DO RECOGNISE THE FINANCIAL PLIGHT OF MOST AUTHORS
AND HAVE SUGGESTED ALTERNATIVES TO PLR IN THE AREAS OF' CURTAILMENT OF LIBRARY
PURCHASES; SPECIAL PRICING OF LIBRARY BOOKS; DIRECT TAX RELIEF; AUGMENTATION
OF ROYALTY INCOME; AND AUGMENTED PROGRAMMES OF LITERARY AWARDS.

LEGAL ASPECTS OF PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). MOST PLR
PROPONENTS CONTENT THAT PLR LEGISLATION IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF COPYRIGHT LAW,
BUT IN ONLY 1 OF THE 10 COUNTRIES TO ENACT PLR LEGISLATION HAS THE STATUTE
BEEN MADE A PART OF COPYRIGHT LAW. THE PLR CONCEPT DOES NOT FIT NEATLY INTO
THE PRINCIPLES OF US COPYRIGHT LAW, BUT THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF 2DROIT
DE SUITE1 LEGISLATION (REQUIRING PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES TO ARTISTS FOR RESALE OF
THEIR WORKS) IN CALIFORNIA IS AN INDICATION THAT PLR IS A WORKABLE CONCEPT IN
THE US LEGAL STRUCTURE.

PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' A HISTORY OF THE IDEA.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). THE IDEA THAT AN
AUTHOR IS ENTITLED TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THE MULTIPLE USES OF HIS COPYRIGHTED
BOOKS IN LIBRARIES IS RELATIVELY NEW, ONLY BEING DISCUSSED SINCE SHORTLY
BEFORE 1920. IDENTIFIES FACTORS THAT HAVE ENCOURAGED THE DEVELOPMENT AND
GROWTH OF THIS CONCEPT; OUTLINES THE ARGUMENTS ADVANED BY ITS PROPONENTS AND
OPPONENTS; BRIEFLY DESCRIBES PLR LEGISLATION IN SCANDINAVIA; AND TRACES THE
CAMPAIGN FOR LEGISLATION IN THE UK.

THE SITUATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). OUTLINES THE
CASES FOR AND AGAINST PLR IN THE UK; THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE PLR
CAMPAIGN; ATTEMPTS TO INTRODUCE PLR LEGISLATION IN PARLIAMENT; PROVISIONS OF
THE PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT ACT PASSED IN 1979; AND MOVES TOWARDS THE ACT'S
IMPLEMENTATION.

SITUATION IN COUNTRIES OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). OUTLINES THE
PLR SCHEMES OPERATING IN DENMARK, NORWAY, SWEDEN, FINLAND, ICELAND, THE
NETHERLANDS, AND WEST GERMANY. ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A JOINT PLR SCHEME IN
SCANDINAVIA, OR AT LEAST RECIPROCAL BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, HAVE BEEN
UNSUCCESSFUL. DENMARK, THE NETHERLANDS, AND WEST GERMANY ARE FACING THE
PROBLEM OF MAINTAINING DIFFERENT SCHEMES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC
COMMUNITY (EEC). OF THESE 3, ONLY WEST GERMANY HAS A PLR SCHEME WHICH IS
WITHIN ITS COPYRIGHT LAWS AND WHICH DOES NOT OPERATE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS
OWN CITIZENS. THE EEC PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF NATIONALITY; THE
EFFECT OF THIS ON PLR IS BEING DEBATED.

PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' THE SOUTH AFRICAN SCENE.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). IN SOUTH
AFRICA, AUTHORS ARE NOT REMUNERATED FOR USE OF THEIR WORKS IN LIBRARIES AND,
IN COMPARISON WITH MOST WESTERN COUNTRIES, VERY LITTLE IS BEING DONE BY THE
STATE TO SUPPORT AUTHORS FINANCIALLY AND STIMULATE LOCAL BOOK PRODUCTION AND
LITERATURE. RELATIVELY FEW PUBLICATIONS ON PLR HAVE APPEARED AND THE AUTHORS'
CAMPAIGN FOR A PLR SYSTEM HAS NOT YET GAINED MOMENTUM.

Document 2999
THE SITUATION IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). DISCUSSION ON
PLR IS MUCH FURTHER ADVANCED IN CANADA THAN IN THE USA-AUTHORS' AND
LIBRARIANS' GROUPS HAVE ISSUED RESOLUTIONS AND MANIFESTOES; FORMAL DEBATES
HAVE BEEN HELD; AND THE CANADA COUNCIL (A GOVERNMENTAL CORPORATION WHICH
ADMINISTERS GRANT PROGRAMMES FOR ARTISTS AND AUTHORS) IS DEVELOPING A MODEL
FOR COMPENSATING AUTHORS, BASED ON HOLDINGS OF THEIR WORKS BY LIBRARIES. GIVEN
THE PRESENT POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE USA, PLR ISSUES ARE NOT AS TIGHTLY DRAWN
THERE. MOST US LIBRARIANS ARE ONLY DIMLY AWARE OF PLR, BUT MILITANCY AMONG
PROFESSIONAL AUTHORS IS GROWING.

PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' THE AMERICAN AUTHOR'S VIEWPOINT.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). PLR FACES
OBSTACLES THAT MAY WELL KEEP IT FROM US SHORES FOR A LONG TIME. A SAMPLING OF
US AUTHORS INDICATES THAT THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS, BUT HARBOUR AN
ATTRACTION TO PLR THAT MAY BLOSSOM INTO THE KIND OF SUPPORT THE CONCEPT HAS
FOUND ELSEWHERE. THIS MAY GIVE PLR A RING OF INEVITABILITY.

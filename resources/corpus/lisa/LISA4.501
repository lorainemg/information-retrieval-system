INDIA'S LIBRARIES ARE WAITING.
     
OUTLINES THE PRESENT UNSTABLE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN INDIA. ONLY
5 STATES HAVE LIBRARY LAWS, OPERATING WITH INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS. THE
LAWS ARE, HOWEVER, WEAK AND FINANCING OF LIBRARIES INADEQUATE. AT UNION LEVEL,
LIBRARY LEGISLATION WAS THE SUBJECT OF A COMMITTEE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD IN
1964, BUT WITH LACK OF INTEREST AMONG THE AUTHORITIES, NO ACTION HAS BEEN
TAKEN YET. IN THE MEANTIME, LIBRARIES FACE CHALLENGES FROM INCREASING NUMBERS
OF USERS, THE NEWLY LITERATE AND STUDENTS. THERE ARE MANY LIBRARY TYPES; APART
FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN CALCUTTA, THERE ARE STATE CENTRAL, DISTRICT,
BLOCK, VILLAGE, MOBILE, UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES OF
VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARIES ARE NUMEROUS. BUT THE NEED FOR
RESOURCES, AND PERHAPS A SUCCESSOR TO THE DYNAMIC S.R. RANGANATHAN, IS GREAT.

LIBRARIES WERE ALLOCATED LARGER PREMISES. 5 OF THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES,
ESTABLISHED AS SUCH IN 1953, MOVED INTO NEW BUILDINGS, WHILE 2 OTHER BUILDINGS
WERE ERECTED FOR LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IN SPITE OF THESE
IMPROVEMENTS, THERE IS STILL A CONSIDERABLE SHORTAGE OF SPACE IN LIBRARIES,
WHICH, IN GENERAL, ARE ALSO IN NEED OF MODERNISATION. REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT,
COMPUTER APPLICATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY MUST NOT ONLY ENSURE BETTER
LENDING SERVICES, INCLUDING INTERLENDING, BUT ALSO COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION
RESOURCES AS WELL AS A WIDER DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. LIKE OTHER
COUNTRIES, MOBILE LIBRARIES SHOULD CATER FOR HAMLETS AND SMALL COMMUNITIES OF
SOME 1,000 INHABITANTS, AND ALSO FOR URBAN POPULATIONS LIVING ON NEW HOUSING
ESTATES AND/OR IN OTHER AREAS TEMPORARILY WITHOUT LIBRARIES. PURPOSE-BUILT
BUILDINGS SHOULD BE ENVISAGED FOR E VERY LIBRARY WITH 70,000 AND MORE VOLUMES.

THE MEDIA CENTRE IN A VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOL.
     
STUDENTS IN A VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOL WILL INCLUDE FORMER PUPILS OF BOTH
GRAMMAR AND SECONDARY MODERN SCHOOLS. SOME STUDENTS WILL BE ON PART TIME, SOME
ON FULL TIME COURSES; MOST OF THEM WILL HAVE HAD SOME WORK EXPERIENCE AND MANY
WILL HAVE PRACTICAL RATHER THAN ACADEMIC ABILITY. THE MEDIA CENTRE NEEDS A
WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECT MATERIAL FOR ALL ACADEMIC LEVELS. SELF-TEACHING
PROGRAMMES ARE VERY IMPORTANT; AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA ARE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IN
DEMONSTRATING THE OPERATION OF MACHINERY. SOME STUDENTS WILL HAVE LEARNING
DIFFICULTIES AND A LACK OF MOTIVATION; PROVISION OF MATERIAL FOR LEISURE AS
WELL AS ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE THE LIBRARY, WHERE
THEY MAY FIND THEIR LAST CHANCE TO MAKE UP FOR EDUCATIONAL DEFICITS. THE MEDIA
CENTRE SHOULD ALSO PROMOTE THE IDEA OF JOB FLEXIBILITY.

PERSPECTIVES ON ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES IN THE 1980S' INDICATORS
FROM A DELPHI STUDY.
     
A DELPHI STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO IDENTIFY THE CHANGES IN LIBRARY ROLES AND
FUNCTIONS THAT THE DIRECTORS OF ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES BELIEVE
WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT DECADE. THE METHODOLOGY IS DESCRIBED AND THE RESULTS
ARE SUMMARISED. 2 SCENARIOS RESULTED' ONE HIGHLY DESIRABLE; THE OTHER, HIGHLY
PROBABLE, AND THEY OVERLAP BY 64%. LIBRARY DIRECTORS EXPECT MODERATE
EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS. USERS ARE PERCEIVED TO BE THE FORCE
MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO, WHILE TECHNOLOGY IS THE FORCE ADVANCING CHANGE.
THE ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY IS SEEN AS DESIRABLE AND WITHIN THE LIBRARIES' SPAN
OF CONTROL. EDUCATION AND SERVICE ROLES OF LIBRARIANS WILL EXPAND. LIBRARY AND
INSTITUTIONAL PRIORITIES ARE SEEN AS OBSTACLES TO CHANGE.

THE FUNCTIONS AND ORGANISATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES/MEDIA CENTRES AS
INDISPENSIBLE PREREQUISITES FOR THE REALISATION OF EDUCATIONAL AIMS HAVE BEEN
DISCUSSED SINCE THE 1970S, BUT LIBRARIANS' HIGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE GENERALLY
NOT BEEN REALISED. EVEN IN COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS, MEDIA CENTRES ARE STILL ONLY
ON THE FRINGE OF SCHOOL LIFE. THE USE OF A MEDIA CENTRE AS A FOCAL POINT OF
SCHOOL ACTIVITIES DEMANDS RADICAL CHANGES IN SCHOOL STRUCTURE AND THE
TEACHER'S ROLE. MANY OF THE MEDIA PROVIDED ARE UNSUITED TO THE SCHOOL LEARNING
SITUATION. TEACHERS HAVE TO SPEND MUCH TIME PLANNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMMES; CLOSE COOPERATION WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIANS WOULD
PROVE HELPFUL HERE. ADMINISTRATION OF CENTRALLY STORED MEDIA IS EFFECTIVE AND
ECONOMICAL BUT SINCE MUCH TIME IS WASTED WHEN CHILDREN MOVE BETWEEN CLASSROOM

CLASSROOMS MUST BE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRE; THEIR
EVOLUTION INTO CLASS MEDIA CENTRES HAS ONLY OCCURRED SO FAR IN PRIMARY
SCHOOLS, A CHANGE DEMANDING GOOD ORGANISATION AND CLOSE LINKS WITH THE PUBLIC

LIBRARY WORK WITH HANDICAPPED CHILDREN IN A BRANCH LIBRARY.
     
THE LIBRARIAN AT A BRANCH LIBRARY IN POTSDAM WORKS CLOSELY WITH TEACHERS AT
THE SPECIAL SCHOOL NEARBY, DISCUSSING SUITABLE LIBRARY MATERIAL AND ARRANGING
SPECIAL EVENTS SUCH AS AUTHORS' VISITS. CHILDREN FROM THE LOWER FORMS ARE
BROUGHT INTO THE LIBRARY TO SAMPLE THE BOOKS AND LEARN ABOUT THE LIBRARY
SERVICE; THE CHILDREN ENJOY THEIR VISITS AND OFTEN RETURN AGAIN DURING LEISURE
HOURS. STOCKS MOST USEFUL TO THEM ARE LARGE PRINT BOOKS AND PICTORIAL
MATERIAL. THE LIBRARIAN HAS ACQUIRED A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF INDIVIDUAL READERS
AND THEIR INTERESTS. THROUGH CLOSE COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES,
HANDICAPPED READERS FROM OTHER AREAS OFTEN COME TO USE THIS LIBRARY. GOOD
CONTACTS WITH PARENTS ARE ALSO VALUABLE; A MEETING IS PLANNED TO INTRODUCE
PARENTS TO LITERATURE ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF HANDICAP.

PUBLIC LIBRARY NEEDS FOR BLACKS' A PERSONAL VIEW.
     
IN SOUTH AFRICA IT OFTEN IS ALLEGED THAT BLACKS REQUIRE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TO
OFFER SERVICES BY WHICH THEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CAPABILITIES. ON
THE MASLOW PYRAMID THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A NEED AT THE BASIC LEVEL, WHILE
THE READING OF RECREATIVE WORKS COULD BE CONSIDERED TO LIE AT A HIGHER LEVEL.
IN FACT IT IS FOUND THAT 72% OF BOOKS BORROWED BY BLACKS CONSIST OF FICTION.
IT MAY NOW BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY PASSED THE
BASIC READING LEVEL, OR WHETHER RECREATIONAL READING FORMS PART OF THAT LEVEL.
AS SOME 66% OF THE BLACK MEMBERSHIP OF A LIBRARY MAY CONSIST OF CHILDREN, THE
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FICTION CIRCULATED RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER THESE
CHILDREN SEE LIBRARIES PRIMARILY AS SOURCES OF INFORMATION, AND ABOUT THE
SUITABILITY OF NON-FICTION PROVIDED. ONLY ABOUT 5% OF BLACKS USE AVAILABLE
LIBRARY FACILITIES. IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE EDUCATIONAL APPROACH
IS NOT BEING OVER-STRESSED IN BLACK PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

USER FLUCTUATION AS THE TOTALITY OF USER MOVEMENT.
     
STATISTICS PRODUCED BY KOPENICK DISTRICT LIBRARY IN BERLIN BETWEEN 1969-79
SHOW THAT EACH YEAR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF NEW USERS ARE REGISTERED ALTHOUGH
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF READERS GROWS ONLY SLOWLY. THESE FIGURES REFLECT NATIONAL

SCIENCES. IT IS DESIRABLE TO SET UP SPECIAL COMMITTEES WHICH HAVE TO FIND WAYS
OF MAXIMISING THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL LITERATURE UPON READERS. RESOLUTE
POLICIES MUST BE PURSUED, STARTING WITH ACQUISITION, WHICH, IN PARTICULAR WITH
RESPECT TO FOREIGN POLITICAL LITERATURE, MUST BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE. CATALOGUING
AND BUILDING UP OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES MUST SATISFY THE READERS' NEEDS IN
SPEEDY CURRENT AWARENESS. EXHIBITIONS ON THE OCCASION OF IMPORTANT POLITICAL
ANNIVERSARIES AND TOPICAL EVENTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIALISED READING AND
STUDY ROOMS, AND ALSO MORE INTENSE RESEARCH INTO THE USE OF POLITICAL
LITERATURE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THE SUGGESTIONS TO ATTRACT SCIENTISTS TO STUDY

(INCLUDING UNIVERSITY, INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES). THE FUNCTION
OF THE SWEDISH NATIONAL LIBRARY IS HELD BY THE ROYAL LIBRARY; THE COORDINATING
ROLE RESTS WITH THE COUNCIL OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE TENDENCY TOWARD
CENTRALISATION RESULTED, IN 1975, IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COUNCIL FOR
INFORMATION SERVICES WITH THE FUNCTION OF CENTRAL COORDINATION AND PLANNING OF
THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE ORGANISATIONAL ROLE IN THIS SPHERE RESTS
WITH THE ROYAL LIBRARY.

THE BACKGROUND TO A ZEELAND AMALGAMATION' THE ZEELAND PROVINCIAL LIBRARY AND
THE MIDDLEBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS THE PROVINCIAL COUNCIL OF ZEELAND AND THE CITY COUNCIL OF
MIDDLEBURG IN 1981 AGREED JOINTLY TO PROVIDE *67 MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION
OF A NEW LIBRARY. THE BUILDING WHICH IS DUE FOR COMPLETION IN 1974 WILL HOUSE
THE COMBINED PROVINCIAL AND CITY LIBRARIES TOGETHER WITH THE ZEELAND CENTRAL
MUSIC LIBRARY. LACK OF SPACE IN THE PRESENT LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND THE NEED FOR
CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PROVINCIAL AND CITY LIBRARIES LED TO THE
DECISION TO COMBINE THEIR SERVICES. THE NEW BUILDING WILL HAVE A SURFACE AREA
OF 12,000 SQ.M. ON 5 FLOORS WITH SPACE FOR 100 STAFF AND EMPHASIS WILL BE
PLACED ON THE USE OF NEW TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS AUTOMATION AND THE ACQUISITION
AND STORAGE OF NEW TYPES OF LIBRARY MATERIALS, INCLUDING AUDIO-VISUAL

THE STRUGGLE FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW-1975 (IN
HEBREW).
     
WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED, IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD
FINANCE 75% OF PUBLIC LIBRARY BUDGETS. THE SITUATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
YEARS HAS BEEN THAT AN EVER-GROWING PERCENTAGE OF THE BUDGET IS COVERED BY
LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THIS HAS NOT ONLY BROUGHT ABOUT A DETERIORATION OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICES, BUT MAY LEAD TO A SITUATION IN WHICH THE LIBRARIES SECTION
OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE WILL BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE THE HIGH
STANDARDS IT HAS SET, SINCE IT WILL NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO PASS ON TO
LOCAL AUTHORITIES. DOCUMENTS THE ACTIONS AND EFFORTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW SINCE ITS FORMATION IN JUNE

RESPONSIBILITY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY.
     
A TALK GIVEN AT A COURSE ON LEADERSHIP-PUBLIC LIBRARIES AT THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES' HIGH SCHOOL, NOV 81. DISCUSSES POLITICIANS' EXPECTATIONS OF THE
LIBRARY AND ITS STAFF. COOPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL POLITICIANS AND LIBRARIANS IS
OFTEN HAMPERED BY THE LIBRARIANS' PREFERENCE FOR CENTRALLY IMPOSED NORMS
INSTEAD OF ADAPTATION TO LOCAL NEEDS. BUT IMPOSITION OF OBLIGATIONS TAKES AWAY
SPONTANEITY. OBJECTS TO SELF-APPOINTED MORALISTS GUIDING THE PEOPLE'S CULTURAL
NEEDS IN A CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL DIRECTION. COMPREHENSIVENESS, ONE OF THE
LIBRARY OBJECTIVES, CANNOT BE ON THE BASIS OF A PARTICULAR BOOK, WHICH MUST
NECESSARILY PRESENT A PARTICULAR VIEWPOINT, BUT MUST BE AN OVERALL GUIDELINE.
THE LIBRARY LAW, LIKE MODERN EDUCATION AND SOCIAL LAWS, SHOULD SPECIFY AN
OBLIGATION TO DEVELOPMENT PLANNING IN THE INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY, NOT LAY DOWN
EXTERNAL STRUCTURAL NORMS WITHOUT REGARD TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. THE LEADING
LIBRARIAN AND THE LEADING HEAD TEACHER MUST HAVE EQUAL  SAY ON THE CULTURAL
COMMITTEE TO SECURE LIBRARIES' INDEPENDENCE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER FROM
THE EDUCATION SERVICE. LIBRARIES MUST NOURISH THE QUALIFIED DOUBT AND SUPPLY
THE MEANS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY IN THE
DEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING PROCESS. LIBRARIES AND LOCAL POLITICIANS MUST
COOPERATE IN KEEPING ART AND CULTURE INDEPENDENT OF POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL

MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES APPLIED IN A SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY.
     
MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES IS SUGGESTED AS A MEANS TO JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OF
AN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE. THE PREREQUISITES ARE THAT THE
INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIAN MUST GRASP THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A
SERVICE FUNCTION OPERATES IN INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THESE
FUNCTIONS. HE MUST ALSO ACQUAINT HIMSELF WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF THE
ORGANISATION HE SERVES AND ARRANGE HIS SERVICES TO MAKE A DEFINABLE
CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE ORGANISATIONAL OBJECTIVES. THE
OBJECTIVES OF THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS MUST BE USED AS PREMISES FOR
DETERMINING WHERE THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FUNCTION SHOULD OPERATE AND HOW
ITS SERVICES SHOULD BE PRESENTED. THE INFORMATION SERVICE (WHICH CONSISTS OF 3
SECTIONS, A LIBRARY, TRANSLATION BUREAU AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION) OF THE
SOUTH AFRICAN IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION (ISCOR) IS USED AS A
WORKING EXAMPLE. THE USE OF MBO BY ISC OR IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED AND THE

PROUD OF THEIR RIGHT TO THE FREE EXPRESSION OF OPINION IN SPEECH AND IN
WRITING, YET THIS VERY FREEDOM CAN CAUSE CONFUSION. SINCE INFORMATION CAN BE
UNSCRUPULOUSLY MANIPULATED A RESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE MUST BE MAINTAINED.
INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION FOR STOCK PURCHASE AND LOANS IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEP
COSTS DOWN. LIBRARIES OFTEN RANK LOW IN LISTS OF CULTURAL PRIORITIES OWING TO
A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS AND A LACK OF PUBLIC INTEREST;
MARKET ECONOMY CRITERIA CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THEM. THE PROVISION OF
INFORMATION AND LITERATURE MUST BE PLANNED RATIONALLY. MANY LIBRARIES HAVE HAD
TO ACCEPT CUTS IN THEIR BUDGETS ALTHOUGH THE PRICES OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS
HAVE RISEN; COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND THE BOOK TRADE MUST BE IMPROVED.

THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'FREE' PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM THEIR AUTHORITIES, IN COMPETITION
WITH OTHER MORE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES ORIGINATED IN THE UK
DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY, THEIR MAIN FUNCTION BEING THE UPLIFTING
OF THE UNEDUCATED. TODAY PUBLIC LIBRARIES MAINLY CONCENTRATE ON THE SUPPLYING
OF LIGHT READING MATTER, ESPECIALLY NOVELS, OF WHICH THE MAJORITY ARE, FROM A
LITERARY POINT OF VIEW, OF A DUBIOUS NATURE. THE ARGUMENTS USED DURING THE
LAST CENTURY TO DEFEND THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE SERVICES ARE NO LONGER VALID
TODAY. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MODERN PUBLIC LIBRARY ARE NEITHER FULLY PART OF
THE WORLD OF EDUCATION NOR THE WORLD OF RECREATION, WITH THE RESULT THAT ITS
IMAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS OBSCURE. CONSIDERS THAT, ALTHOUGH CONTINUED
FINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT IS
NECESSARY, NO VALID OBJECTION CAN BE FOUND TO CHARG E USERS FOR THOSE SERVICES
WHICH ARE NOT ESSENTIAL FOR THE AIMS WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARY PURSUES.

STOCK SUPPLEMENTED BY CENTRAL RESERVES. SINCE THEY ARE ONLY IN 1 PLACE FOR A
SHORT TIME, HOWEVER, THEY CANNOT EASILY BECOME CULTURAL CENTRES. SMALL
STATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS HAVE SMALL, RESTRICTED STOCKS AND
ARE RARELY SERVED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF. A COMPARISON OF INITIAL AND RUNNING
COSTS FOR MOBILE AND SMALL STATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN MIDDLE FRANCONIA

POLICY THE CULTURAL PRODUCERS MUST INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE WHOLE SPHERE OF
LOCAL POLITICS. LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES AND LEGISLATION LAYING DOWN MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES,
AS IN FINLAND, SHOULD BE ENACTED. AFTER THE BOOM IN THE 60S AND 70S, THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES HAVE TO MAKE CUTS; AS THEY CANNOT REDUCE PREVIOUS CAPITAL
INVESTMENT THEY CUT CURRENT EXPENDITURE ON CULTURAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SCHOOLS
AND LIBRARIES, ALTHOUGH MONEY SEEMS ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR SPORT, BUREAUCRACY
AND DATA TECHNOLOGY. THE REAL POWER OF DECISION-MAKING LIES NOT WITH THE
CULTURAL, BUT WITH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUDGETING.
CULTURAL CONSUMERS SHOULD BE AS POLITICALLY ACTIVE AS THE PRESSURE GROUPS FOR
SPORT AND TRY TO INFLUENCE LOCAL POLITICIANS,  IF A CATASTROPHE FOR CULTURE IS

SURVEYS THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND, THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND UP TO THE 1920S, THE
QUALIFICATIONS AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS REQUIRED OF WOMEN IN
LIBRARIANSHIP, AS WELL AS THEIR PART IN LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. WOMEN FIRST
BECAME ACCEPTED IN LIBRARIANSHIP WHEN THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF MEN
AVAILABLE. THE WOMEN, MOSTLY FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS, RUSHED INTO A PROFESSION
WHICH DID NOT DETRACT FROM SOCIAL PRESTIGE. STEREOTYPED IDEAS CONCERNING
FEMALE QUALITIES MADE THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE PROFESSION EASIER' ACCURACY,
INDUSTRY, SELF-DENIAL AND SUBORDINATION ON THE ONE HAND; SOCIAL SENSITIVITY,
MOTHERLY FEELING AND INSIGHT INTO PEOPLE'S NATURE ON THE OTHER. THE GROWING
NUMBER OF WOMEN IN LIBRARIANSHIP MADE AN ORGAN FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF THEIR
INTERESTS DESIRABLE. THE 'VEREINIGUNG BIBLIOTEKARISCH ARBEITENDER FRAUEN',
FOUNDED IN 1907, MADE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PAYMENT, INFORM INTERESTED PEOPLE
ABOUT THE PROFESSION AND ABOUT ED UCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, AND PROVIDED AN

PATENT COVERAGE BY ABSTRACTING SERVICES. 4. COVERAGE OF MICROBIOLOGICAL
PATENTS.
     
REPORTS A STUDY ON THE COVERAGE BY 7 MAJOR ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE FIELD
OF MICROBIOLOGY IN REGARD TO PATENTS. ONLY 3 OF THE SERVICES-2CHEMICAL
ABSTRACTS, MICROBIOLOGY ABSTRACTS, SECTION +A, 1AND 2FOOD SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY ABSTRACTS1-COVER PATENTS AT ALL. THE 3 SERVICES WERE ASSESSED IN
TERMS OF THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE ABOUT PATENTS AND IN TERMS OF THEIR
PERFORMANCE IN RETRIEVING PATENTS TAKEN FROM A MASTER LIST OF PATENTS ON
GENETIC ENGINEERING AND VITAMIN D, OBTAINED BY SEARCHES ON 2WORLD PATENTS
INDEX. 1TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES WAS ALSO ASSESSED. IT WAS FOUND THAT NONE
OF THE STANDARD ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE FIELD COVER PATENTS SATISFACTORILY
AND THEY ARE SLOW IN PICKING UP PATENTS. THE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT BY
SCANNING JUST JAPANESE, U.S.S.R. U.S., AND U.K. PATENTS, BOTH TIMELY AND
COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE MICROBIOLOGICAL PATENT LITERATURE CAN BE
OBTAINED.

LIBRARIANS MORE SERVICE ORIENTATED, AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT RESEARCH TIME

FROM ACROSS THE ACADEMIC SPECTRUM SUBMITTED 27 PROFILES. REFERENCES WERE
SUPPLIED FROM JOURNALS AND MONOGRAPHS AND FROM ABSTRACTING TOOLS WHERE THE
LIBRARY HAD POOR LITERATURE COVERAGE. AT THE END OF THE 6 MONTHS, FEEDBACK
REVEALED THAT 93% OF THE REFERENCES ASSESSED (82%) WERE RELEVANT OR APPARENTLY
RELEVANT, SHOWING THAT BIBLIOGRAPHIC RATHER THAN TERMINOLOGICAL SKILLS WERE
THE SALIENT FACTOR. ACADEMIC RESPONSE WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF A
CONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE, WHILE A FEW RESPONDENTS WANTED MINOR
IMPROVEMENTS. THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT THE SERVICE INCREASED JOB

REPLACE HALMSTAD CENTRAL LIBRARY'S AUTHOR EVENINGS, BUT TO COMPLEMENT THEM
WITH ACTIVITIES IN A BRANCH LIBRARY. NEW FORMS WERE SOUGHT WHICH INVOLVED THE
PARTICIPANTS IN ACTIVE LISTENING AND CONVERSATION. A CAFE ATMOSPHERE WITH
COFFEE AND CAKES WAS CREATED. MANY OF THE POETS LIVED LOCALLY. THE LIBRARY

THE LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WENT UP IN SMOKE.
     
SINCE 1977, THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS STRESSED THAT AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES
SHOULD BEGIN WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS. BIBLIOTEKSDATA HAS REPLIED THAT THEIR
DEVELOPMENT PLANS AGREE WITH THIS PRIORITY, BUT ADDS THAT LOCAL LIBRARIES MUST
BE FREE TO DECIDE WHICH AUTOMATION SYSTEM TO USE. FEARS THAT BIBLIOTEKSDATA,
IN EFFECT, IS GIVING PRIORITY TO AUTOMATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS, SUCH AS
ISSUES AND ACQUISITIONS, ALTHOUGH THE UNION HAS ARGUED THE NEED FOR TERMINAL
ACCESS FOR LIBRARIES TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. PROVISION OF SUCH ACCESS
HAS BEEN HELD UP BY THE FACT THAT THE QUESTION OF THE BEST SUBJECT SEARCH
SYSTEM HAS NOT YET BEEN SOLVED. MEANTIME, HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS SHOULD BE MADE TO
PROVIDE TERMINAL ACCESS WITH FREE TEXT SEARCHING, SIMILAR SEARCHING ON
MICROFORM, AND EXPANSION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES WITH SUBJECT WORDS. ARGUES

PLANNING WAS ADVOCATED ON A BASIS OF DIFFERENTIAL VALUES FOR STOCK ITEMS PER
INHABITANT, SO THAT STOCKS CAN BE ACQUIRED WHICH ALLOW FOR SOCIAL DEMANDS.
FUNCTIONAL EQUIPPING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY IS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE

EMPHASISES STOCK EXPANSION AND THE PURCHASE OF REPLACEMENT COPIES; OTHER
GUIDELINES COVER THE EXPANSION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA SERVICES, NEW RULES ON

IN 1975 THE NUMBER OF STOCK ITEMS PER INHABITANT IN LEIPZIG LIBRARIES WAS
SLIGHTLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, SO PLANS FOR 1976-80 EMPHASISED STOCK
EXPANSION. VARIABLE PROVISION STANDARDS WERE CALCULATED FOR CENTRAL AND BRANCH
LIBRARIES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FOR THIS PERIOD SHOWS A LARGE STOCK
BUDGET, SO THAT IN SEVERAL AREAS THE REQUIRED LEVELS OF STOCK PROVISION WERE
REACHED OR EVEN EXCEEDED. ONLY SOME OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED AREAS FELL
BELOW THE REQUISITE STANDARDS. OTHER AIMS FOR 1976-80 WERE THE EXPANSION AND
QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS IN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY AND THE RAISING OF
PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES. PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED WITH
STOCKS FOR RURAL LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY FOR PART-TIME BRANCH LIBRARIES;
GUIDELINES FOR 1981-85 AIM TO IMPROVE THIS ASPECT OF THE SERVICE.

COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SOVIET SERIAL EXCHANGES.
     
WHILE THE TRADITIONAL VIEW HAS BEEN THAT SOVIET PUBLICATIONS WERE BEST

THE GROWTH OF THE HUNGARIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S OBJECTIVES AND
RESEARCH TEAM, THE LACK OF SPACE AND THE RISE IN JOURNAL PRICES INDUCED THE
LIBRARIANS TO EXAMINE THE USAGE OF JOURNALS. THEY WISHED TO ESTABLISH JOURNALS
WHICH NEED NOT BE SUBSCRIBED TO ANY LONGER; JOURNALS WHICH COULD BE PLACED IN
REMOTE STORAGE; AND JOURNALS WHICH READERS REGULARLY REQUIRE BUT WHICH ARE NOT
AVAILABLE IN THE LIBRARY. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 1 NOV 77 -30 APR 78. AS A
RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION IT CAN BE LAID DOWN THAT THE LIBRARY CAN COMPLY,
FROM ITS OWN STOCK, WITH A LARGE PART OF READERS' DEMANDS FOR JOURNALS. THE
SMALLER PART (29%) OF THE STOCK FULFILS 77% OF DEMANDS, THE LARGER PROPORTION
IS LITTLE USED. THE NUMBER OF JOURNALS NOT USED AT ALL IS SMALL. JOURNALS USED
LESS WILL BE PUT IN DISTANT STACKS; CURRENT JOURNALS AND OFTEN USED VOLUMES
WILL BE STORED IN THE LIBRARY.

CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT CATALOGUING IN THE 1980S' IFLA'S ROLE.
     
BASED ON AN INTRODUCTORY PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST OPEN MEETING OF THE IFLA
SECTION ON CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT CATALOGUING, AT THE IFLA ANNUAL
CONFERENCE, LEIPZIG, EAST GERMANY, AUG 81. OUTLINES TRENDS WHICH HAVE RESULTED
IN CHANGES IN THE ROLE OF CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDEXING IN THE LAST
DECADE' LESS TIME FOR CLASSIFICATION AND INDEXING; INCREASED INTEREST IN
GENERAL CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES AND SUBJECT INDEXING SYSTEMS; MORE CENTRALISED
OR SHARED PROCESSING; AND INCREASED INTEREST IN RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. DESCRIBES

REGARDING CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE SCIENCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATIONS.
     
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE CLASSIFICATIONS AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CLASSIFICATIONS HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED BY THE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER OF
KNOWLEDGE AND THE UNI-DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION.
SEMANTIC CATALOGUES EXIST IN A LOGICAL STATE OF PROBABILITY NOT ONLY BECAUSE
OF THE TEMPORAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THEIR PREPARATION AND CONSULTATION, BUT
BECAUSE THEY CAN NEVER BE VERIFIED, EXCEPT AFTER A GREAT TIME LAG. THE PROBLEM
IS ALWAYS THE SEARCH FOR FORMULAE FOR REFERENCES PROVIDING THE GREATEST
GUARANTEE OF INTERCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN SUBJECTS. THERE IS A VITAL NEED TO
DEFINE THEORETICALLY AND LOGICALLY THE 'SUBJECT' IN RELATION TO THE 'OBJECT'.

APPLICATION OF THE SOVIET CLASSIFICATION SCHEME IN BULGARIA'S SCIENTIFIC
LIBRARIES.
     
SINCE 1970, WORK HAS BEEN IN PROGRESS TO GRADUALLY INTRODUCE THE SOVIET
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME (REFERRED TO AS BBK) INTO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES IN
BULGARIA. THE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACHIEVING THIS TARGET HAS BEEN THAT OF
THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL
COMMITTEE FOR CULTURE AND OTHER BODIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY'S STAFF HAVE BEEN
PRINCIPALLY INVOLVED IN TRANSLATING AND EDITING THE UNABRIDGED
30-VOLUME-BBK-VERSION WHICH HAS BEEN PUBLISHED FROM 1973-81. THE LARGE
SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES WILL BE CATERED FOR WITH THIS EDITION. PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
LIBRARIES IN SCHOOLS AND OTHERS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH ABRIDGED VERSIONS
ADAPTED FOR THEIR SPECIAL NEEDS. VARIOUS GUIDE BOOKS, EITHER TRANSLATED FROM
RUSSIAN OR WRITTEN BY BULGARIAN EXPERTS, WILL ASSIST LIBRARIANS TO APPLY THE
BBK IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. AN ITEMISED ACCOUNT FOR INTRODUCING THE BBK IS
GIVEN; IT IS EMPHASISED, IN PARTICULAR, THAT THE BBK IS THE ONLY
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BASED ON MARXISM-LENINISM.

PRESENTS A STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF THE MUSIC SCHEDULES OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL
CLASSIFICATION AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S PROPOSAL FOR A TOTAL REVISION OF
THESE SCHEDULES. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE ABILITY OF EACH CLASSIFICATION
TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF LIBRARY PATRONS USING THE SHELF ARRANGEMENT TO RETRIEVE
SCORES FOR PERFORMANCE PURPOSES. THE BASIS OF THE COMPARISON PRESENTED HERE IS
A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 400 CHAMBER-MUSIC SCORES CHOSEN FROM THE 2BRITISH CATALOGUE
OF MUSIC1. EACH CLASSIFICATION IS ANALYSED FOR ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN
TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PERFORMERS, AND THE CLASSIFICATIONS
ARE THEN COMPARED USING STANDARD STATISTICAL METHODS. CONCLUDES WITH A

USING THE TEXT TELEPHONE-SOMETHING FOR LIBRARIES?.
     
DESCRIBES THE TEXT TELEPHONE INSTALLED IN LANDSKRONA PUBLIC LIBRARY EARLY IN
1981 FOR THE USE OF THE DEAF AND SPEECH IMPAIRED. IT CONSISTS OF 3 UNITS' AN
ORDINARY TELEPHONE, A KEYBOARD USED TO TYPE THE TEXT, AND A SCREEN MONITOR,
WHICH RECEIVES AND TRANSMITS THE TEXT. THE HANDICAPPED PERSON NEEDS ALSO A
SIGNAL RELAY, WHICH TRANSFORMS THE AUDIBLE TELEPHONE SIGNALS TO VISUAL
SIGNALS, AND HE MUST BE ABLE TO TYPE AS THE KEYBOARD IS THAT OF A STANDARD
TYPEWRITER. DISABLED PEOPLE CAN CONTACT OTHERS WITH SIMILAR EQUIPMENT, BUT
CONTACT TO AN ORDINARY TELEPHONE REQUIRES A TRANSFORMER. THE TELEPHONE
DIRECTORY HAS SPECIAL MARKINGS FOR TEXT TELEPHONES. EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE,
WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH NEW AND ISOLATED GROUPS, HAS BEEN
LIMITED BY LACK OF FINANCE.

LITERATURE AND READING IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.
     
STATISTICS FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS IN EAST GERMANY REFLECT THE SUCCESS ACHIEVED
BY THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY IN STIMULATING PUBLIC INTEREST IN READING AND IN
TRYING TO SATISFY READERS' NEEDS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING THE WIDEST
POSSIBLE RANGE OF MATERIAL ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IS
RECOGNISED. FOREIGN MATERIAL MOST IN DEMAND IS THAT FROM THE USSR, FOLLOWED BY
WORKS FROM OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES AND FROM THE THIRD WORLD. NATURALLY A
WIDE RANGE OF CONTEMPORARY DOMESTIC LITERATURE IS ALSO AVAILABLE. IN 1980,
LIBRARY STOCKS TOTALLED 80 MILLION ITEMS AND THE BOOKTRADE TURNOVER HAS
INCREASED BY 32% DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS. CLOSE LINKS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED
BETWEEN AUTHORS, PUBLISHERS AND THE PUBLIC. MORE RESEARCH INTO READING HABITS
AND COMMUNICATION THROUGH LITERATURE IS REQUIRED.

DECIDED THAT THE CAMPAIGN SHOULD CONSIST OF 2 PROJECTS' A REGIONAL PROJECT, IN
WHICH NEW METHODS SHOULD BE USED TO STIMULATE INTEREST IN READING AND IMPROVE
THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKS, AND THE EFFECTS OF THE METHODS EVALUATED; AND A
NATIONAL INFORMATION CAMPAIGN WITH THE OBJECT OF GIVING INFORMATION ABOUT
BOOKS, AND STIMULATE INTEREST IN THE REGIONAL PROJECT. CONTACT WITH VARIOUS
ORGANISATIONS WAS MADE, ABOVE ALL THE PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION. IN THE
REGIONAL PROJECT THE EMPHASIS WAS TO BE ON LOCAL INVOLVEMENT. THE PROJECT,
CALLED THE DALA PROJECT, IS TO START IN THE AUTUMN 81 IN THE KOPPARBERG REGION
AND HAS 4 CORNERSTONES' SCHOOLS, PUBLIC LIBRARIES, STUDY CIRCLES AND MASS
MEDIA. THE PROJECT SHOULD LEAD TO COOPERATION AND BETTER USE OF RESOURCES, BUT

AN EXAMINATION OF BOOK BUYERS AND LIBRARY USERS.
     
VERY FEW PEOPLE EITHER ONLY BUY THEIR BOOKS OR ONLY OBTAIN THEM FROM A LIBRARY
AND MANY PEOPLE BUY BOOKS AS OFTEN AS THEY BORROW THEM. LIBRARY USERS WHO
BORROW FEW BOOKS BUY A LARGER PROPORTION OF THEIR BOOKS THAN LIBRARY USERS WHO
BORROW MANY BOOKS. HOWEVER, WHEREAS OVER 1/2 THE POPULATION OF GERMANY BUY
BOOKS, ONLY ABOUT 1/4 USE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT
IMPORTANT INFLUENCES ON BEHAVIOUR REGARDING THE USE OF BOOKS INCLUDE THE HOME
BACKGROUND, SCHOOL AND GENERAL SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SENSE OF
VALUES ALSO PLAYS ITS PART, OFTEN INFLUENCED BY THE MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION
POSSIBILITIES. PERHAPS THE MAIN INFLUENCE IS THE SOCIAL LEARNING PROCESS AND
AN INDIVIDUAL'S OWN ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT. THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS UNEXPLORED
POSSIBILITIES FOR INFLUENCING CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN THEIR USE OF BOOKS.

CARRY OUT A READING CAMPAIGN IN YOUR CLASS.
     
A READING CAMPAIGN WAS CARRIED OUT IN CLASS 3B OF ISLEV SCHOOL IN RODOVRE,
DENMARK, IN WHICH THE PUPILS AIMED TO READ AT HOME A TOTAL OF 200 BOOKS FROM
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN 9 WEEKS. THE READERS WERE GIVEN A TIME IN WHICH TO READ
EACH BOOK AND USED A FORM TO REPORT ON THE CONTENT, ILLUSTRATIONS AND EASE OF
READING. THESE COMMENTS WERE READ TO THE CLASS EACH WEEK. THE 1ST BATCH OF
BOOKS WAS CHOSEN BY THE 2 TEACHERS CONCERNED, THE NEXT BY TEACHERS AND PUPILS
TOGETHER IN THE LIBRARY, AND THE LAST MAINLY BY THE PUPILS THEMSELVES. IF NO
BOOK ATTRACTED A CHILD, HE OR SHE COULD CHOSE 1 FROM THE LIBRARY WITH HELP
FROM THE LIBRARIAN. A 'BOOK THERMOMETER' IN THE CLASSROOM SHOWED PROGRESS IN
READING THE 200 BOOKS. AN EXHIBITION ON THE PROJECT WAS MOUNTED IN THE LIBRARY
AND A TAPE WAS MADE OF SOME OF THE READERS' OPINIONS. THE CAMPAIGN STIMULATED
INTEREST IN READING AND IN BORROWING BOOKS FROM THE SCHOOL LIBRARY AND SOME
CHILDREN WHO HAD NEVER READ A BOOK BEFORE NOW DID SO, SOMETIMES AS A RESULT OF
THE RECORDED COMMENTS. THE AIM WAS FULFILLED, ALL 200 BOOKS BEING READ DURING
THE 9-WEEK PERIOD.

THE ROMANIZATION OF CYRILLIC SCRIPT.
     
IN TERMS OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL IS 2ND ONLY TO
ENGLISH LANGUAGE PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL NO GENERALLY ACCEPTED
SCHEME IN THE WESTERN WORLD FOR CONVERTING CYRILLIC CHARACTERS INTO ROMAN
SCRIPT. TRANSCRIPTION, BY WHICH CYRILLIC CHARACTERS ARE ROMANIZED INTO
PHONEMES, GIVES GOOD RESULTS FOR PRONUNCIATION BUT LEADS TO A NUMBER OF
ALTERNATIVE SPELLINGS, WHILST TRANSLITERATION, BY WHICH A SINGLE ROMAN
CHARACTER IS SUBSTITUTED FOR EACH CYRILLIC CHARACTER LEADS TO PRONUNCIATION

PRESENTS THE CONCLUSIONS OF A PAPER GIVEN AT A BRAZILIAN SEMINAR ON LITERATURE
FOR CHILDREN IN 1978. 21 CHILDREN'S BOOKS BY BRAZILIAN AUTHORS WERE EXAMINED,
AND FOUND TO BE COMPOSED ACCORDING TO A RIGID PREDETERMINED STRUCTURE BASED ON
A CLEAR AND ABSOLUTE DEMARCATION OF GOOD AND EVIL, BACKED BY AN IDEOLOGY
LEGITIMISING THE POWER OF ADULTS OVER CHILDREN. DRAWS A PARALLEL WITH THE
SUBLITERATURE OF 19TH CENTURY FRANCE, AND POSTULATES THAT BRAZILIAN CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE IS FUNDAMENTALLY A PRODUCT OF THE PREVAILING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
ORDER, REFLECTING IN THE DEPICTION OF THE PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP THE
PRODUCER-CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY. THE INTRODUCTION OF
SUPERFICIALLY CONTEMPORARY MATERIAL IN LANGUAGE AND PHYSICAL DETAIL DOES NOT
AFFECT THE ESSENTIALLY REACTIONARY CHARACTER OF SUCH WORKS, AND THIS
IDEOLOGICAL RIGIDITY EXPLAINS THEIR LOW LITERARY QUALITY.

OLD BOOKBINDING TECHNIQUES IN MODERN RESTORATION OF WRITTEN MATERIAL, 6' THE
CONSTRUCTION OF GLOBES.
     
THE FIRST GLOBE OF THE EARTH WAS MADE AT THE END OF THE 15TH CENTURY; GLOBES
OF THE HEAVENS WERE IN EXISTENCE SOME TIME EARLIER. METHODS OF GLOBE
MANUFACTURE FROM THE 18TH CENTURY ONWARDS ARE DESCRIBED TO ILLUSTRATE THE NEED
FOR CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT. GLOBE MANUFACTURE FREQUENTLY INVOLVES WORK BY A
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CRAFTSMEN. A GEOGRAPHER, MATHEMATICIAN OR ASTRONOMER
CREATES THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN, THEN A CARPENTER PROVIDES A BASIC WOODEN
STRUCTURE WHICH IS COVERED WITH PAPER PASTE. THE MAP MUST BE CUT INTO SECTIONS
BEFORE BEING FIXED ONTO THE GLOBE AND THEN A TOP LAYER OF LIME OR CHALK IS
ADDED. AN ALTERNATIVE MANUFACTURING METHOD IS TO FILL A POTTERY MOULD WITH
PAPER MACHE. POCKET GLOBES ARE OFTEN MADE ENTIRELY OF WOOD. A GLOBE MUST BE
LIGHT, EASILY TURNED BUT PERFECTLY BALANCED.

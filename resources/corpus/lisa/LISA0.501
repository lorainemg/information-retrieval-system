SURVEY OF CZECH AND SLOVAK PERIODICALS AND BULLETINS ON LIBRARIANSHIP AND
INFORMATICS.

MORE THAN 20 PERIODICALS, NEWSLETTERS AND OTHER PAPERS DEALING WITH THE THEORY
AND PRACTICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ARE LISTED. THE SLOVAK
CITATEL' AND ITS CZECH COUNTERPART CTENAR NOW CATER FOR LIBRARIES IN GENERAL.
ALTHOUGH ORIGINALLY DESIGNED WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN MIND. OTHER PERIODICALS
ARE MORE SPECIALISED, DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND
ECONOMIC LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES IN INDUSTRY; IN UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE
AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIES IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
ESTABLISHMENTS. THEIR EDITORIAL STAFF MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO IMPART INFORMATION
TO THEIR READERS, NOT ONLY ON LIBRARY ROUTINES AND TECHNIQUES, BUT ALSO SOME
INSIGHT INTO THE READERS PSYCHOLOGY, THE SITUATION IN A SIMILAR FIELD ABROAD,
THE LATEST PUBLICATIONS, IMPORTANT EVENTS OF PUBLIC INTEREST AND THE LIKE. A
SPECIAL NEWSLETTER TAKES UP CONSTRUCTION OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS , THEIR
FURNISHING AND EQUIPMENT, BOOK COLLECTIONS AND CATALOGUING. ALTHOUGH SLOVAK
TRADE UNIONS AS WELL AS MUSEUM AND AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES STILL LACK
PERIODICALS OF THEIR OWN, THE CHOICE IS WIDE AND NO LIBRARIAN AND/OR
INFORMATION SCIENTIST NEED BE BEHIND THE TIMES.

YEARS OF CITATEL'.ON

THE EVE OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY, THE MAIN POINTS OF THE PERIODICAL'S HISTORY
ARE OUTLINED. IT WAS FOUNDED WITH THE MAIN PURPOSE OF ASSISTING STAFF IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES. WITH TIME, ITS IMPACT HAS SPREAD TO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES,
IN PARTICULAR IN SLOVAKIA. LIBRARIANS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF NEW, INVENTIVE
IDEAS, BOTH FROM HOME AND ABROAD. THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE
SOVIET UNION HAS ALWAYS ATTRACTED SPECIAL ATTENTION. ALTHOUGH THE EDUCATIONAL
ROLE OF CITATEL' HAS BEEN EMPHASISED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE, THERE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN ENOUGH SPACE ON ITS PAGES TO ADVISE LIBRARIANS OF IMPROVEMENT IN
WORKING CONDITIONS, AND TO CAMPAIGN FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW LIBRARIES.
TODAY, CITATEL' IS WELL ESTABLISHED NOT ONLY IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA, BUT IT ALSO
HAS A GOOD REPUTATION ABROAD, AND INTEREST IN IT IS ON THE INCREASE.

FOR GOOD OR EVIL, LIBRARIANSHIP IS STERILE.

LIBRARIANS FAIL TO ATTRACT THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO THEIR RANKS; THEY ARE NEITHER
INVENTIVE NOR INNOVATIVE, THERE IS TOO LITTLE IN LIBRARIANSHIP TO JUSTIFY EVEN
A FIRST DEGREE; ONLY LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES WOULD CONSIDER THEIR OCCUPATION TO
BE A PROFESSION; AND FELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR AWARD ON AN HONORARY
BASIS (AND THEN ONLY RARELY). LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD RECOGNISE ITS MODEST PLACE
IN SOCIETY, RECRUIT THOSE WITH A NATURAL FLAIR FOR ORGANISATION, AND ORGANISE
ITSELF ALONG BUSINESSLIKE LINES TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THE NATURE OF WHICH DOES
NOT NEED EXPLICATING EXCEPT TO THOSE MORE INTERESTED IN ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHY
THAN PRACTICAL UTILITY. LIBRARIANSHIP IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN RHETORIC THAN
LOGIC.

HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. THE LECTURES GIVEN SHOWED A GOOD THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
VERY OFTEN MORE ADVANCED THAN THE PRACTICAL ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO THE
HANDICAPPED AND DISABLED. LIBRARIANS CAN INFLUENCE THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S
ATTITUDE TO THEIR HANDICAPPED FELLOW-CITIZENS. THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS
MADE SOME USEFUL SUGGESTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, ADJUSTMENT OF LIBRARY EQUIPMENT FOR
THE HANDICAPPED, DEVELOPMENT OF READING AIDS FOR BEDRIDDEN PEOPLE AND THE

THE HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES.

THE HANDICAPPED ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR SPREADING KNOWLEDGE OF
AVAILABLE AIDS AND THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES. SOCIETY CREATES THE HANDICAP BY
MAKING ACTIVITIES UNAVAILABLE. IT IS THEREFORE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIETY
AND INDIVIDUALS TO SEE THAT OBSTACLES ARE REMOVED NOT JUST TO BETTER LIVING
CONDITIONS, BUT ALSO TO A FULL CULTURAL LIFE FOR THE HANDICAPPED. THE DEMAND
FOR INFORMATION ON MATERIAL FOR THE HANDICAPPED AVAILABLE IN LIBRARIES WAS
SHOWN IN A CAMPAIGN LED BY KALMAR REGIONAL LIBRARY TO BE GROWING AMONG
TEACHERS TRYING TO INTEGRATE THE HANDICAPPED IN SCHOOLS. STAFF WITHIN THE
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS CAN ALSO ACT AS LINKS BETWEEN THE HANDICAPPED AND THE
LIBRARY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY MUST STIMULATE LOCAL LIBRARIES TO INITIATE
DOMICILIARY SERVICES AND ESTABLISH SYSTEMS FOR LENDING OF SPEAKING BOOKS AND
PERSONAL CONTACTS WITH USERS. THE MASS MEDIA AND SPECIAL TEACHERS ARE OTHER
MEANS OF REACHING THE HANDICAPPED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARY SERVI CES.

MAKE LIBRARIES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL!.

6 YEARS AFTER THE GOVERNMENT AGREED ON A NEW CULTURAL POLICY, NO PROPOSALS FOR
SUCH A POLICY ON THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED EXIST. DESPITE OUR CONCERN FOR
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MANY HANDICAPPED ARE DENIED ACCESS TO THE SPOKEN AND
PRINTED WORD. LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE THEIR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
AVAILABLE TO ALL. DIRECT PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT THE HANDICAPPED CAN
REACH THE LIBRARY, ENTER IT AND STAY THERE. BUT IMPROVED BUILDINGS AND
TRANSPORT CANNOT REPLACE THE DOMICILIARY LIBRARY SERVICE. INDIRECT
ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AND MEDIA MUST BE ADAPTED TO REACH
NEW GROUPS. 'EASY READERS' ARE AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A MEDIUM AND THEIR
PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED. THE NEW STATE
LIBRARY FOR SPEECH AND BRAILLE PRINTING IS THE 1ST STAGE IN PROVISION FOR THE
BLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED; THE NEXT IS THE INCREASED DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH
MATERIAL TO OTHER GROUPS.

INFORMATION EDUCATION OF PUPILS AND THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER.

THE 'INFORMATION EDUCATION' OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IS NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY

PROCESS IN EVERY SUBJECT. SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY OPERATED ON A
RUDIMENTARY LEVEL AS BOOKSTOCKS WITH LENDING OUTLETS-MOSTLY SUPPLYING
LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE TEACHING OF THE MOTHER TONGUE. THIS IS NO LONGER
ADEQUATE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES MUST BE TRANSFORMED INTO UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION
AND STUDY CENTRES. THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ISSUED A DIRECTIVE NO
3767/1979 WHICH ENVISAGES SCHOOL LIBRARIES FULFILLING 3 ROLES' SUPPLYING
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MATERIAL TO BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS; CONTRIBUTING TO
THE UPBRINGING OF THE NEW SOCIALIST GENERATION THROUGH WORKING WITH BOOKS;
EDUCATING BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS TO USE INFORMATION SOURCES INDEPENDENTLY

THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY USER

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHICAL MODEL'
PUBLIC LIBRARY USE IS A FUNCTION OF (1) INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS; (2)
AWARENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES; (3) PERCEIVED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LIBRARY; (4)
PERCEIVED EASE OF USE OF THE LIBRARY; AND (5) USE OF OTHER NON-PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE MODEL WAS TESTED WITH 4 DIFFERENT LIBRARY USE MEASURES-A
DICHOTOMISED MEASURE OF USE AND NONUSE, AND, AMONG LIBRARY USERS, FREQUENCY OF
USE AND 2-FACTOR ANALYTICALLY DERIVED INDEXES DESCRIPTIVE OF 2 DISTINCTLY
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY USE. TYPE 1 USE APPEARED TO MEASURE USE INTENSITY;
TYPE 2-IN-HOUSE USE. INTERVIEW DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 202 RESIDENTS OF
SYRACUSE, NEW YORK. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS PERCEIVED THE
LIBRARY AS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN DID NONUSERS, AND USE FREQUENCY WAS RELATED TO
AWARENESS OF SPECIAL LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, AS WAS INTENSITY OF USE, AND IN-HOUSE
USE WAS RELATED  TO USE OF OTHER LIBRARIES.

LIBRARIES AND SCIENCE.

THE MAIN CONCERN OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES SHOULD BE SPEEDY AND
EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO USERS. THEY MUST BE CONCERNED TO ELIMINATE ANY
UNNECESSARY DELAYS, WHICH MAY CAUSE DELAYS IN THE SCIENTIST'S WORK. LIBRARIANS
SHOULD TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THEIR USERS AND THEIR EDUCATION
AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. A SURVEY IN THE SLOVAK
ACADEMY OF SCIENCE HAD SHOWN THAT MOST SOUGHT AFTER ARE INFORMATION SOURCES
1-3 YEARS OLD IN NATURAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, 1-10 YEARS OLD IN THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES. GOOD ACQUISITION POLICY, QUALITY IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATION
SERVICES CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL

LIMITING FACTORS IN THIS LIBRARY THAN EITHER CIRCULATION OR LIBRARY ERROR. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER STUDY BE MADE OF THE EXTENT OF USE OF THE HOLDINGS
OF OTHER LIBRARIES, AND OF THE PROPORTION OF USERS WHO COME TO BROWSE OR
SEARCH BY SUBJECT RATHER THAN SPECIFIC TITLE, BEFORE CHANGING ACQUISITIONS
POLICY. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF USER ERROR INDICATES A LACK OF ADEQUATE

SOME ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARIAN-USER RELATIONSHIP.

ARGUES THAT DIRECT LIBRARIAN-USER INTERACTION IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CLOSE
SCRUTINY, SINCE THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY NOT BE IN HARMONY WITH THE OVERALL
STANDARD OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS OF THE INFORMATION CENTRE. POINTS OUT THAT, APART
FROM QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE, A LIBRARIAN MUST ALSO POSSESS A
PERSONALITY WHICH IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY WELL BALANCED AND ADAPTABLE, SINCE A
GREAT DEAL OF HIS/HER WORK INVOLVES EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY STRESSFUL
SITUATIONS. THESE SITUATIONS ARISE WITH USERS WHO ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUT
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING A PARTICULAR INFORMATION
SOURCE AND WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE THAT OTHER READERS HAVE THEIR
PRESSING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. NAME TAGS FOR LIBRARIANS SHOULD LEAD TO GREATER
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN LARGE LIBRARIES DIRECT USER CONTACT INVOLVES SHIFT
WORKING FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE STAFF; THIS LEADS TO DIFFICULTIES AND
SOMETIMES LESS THAN ADEQUATE PERSONNEL ARE EXPOSED TO THE PU BLIC. THIS AREA

THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR
LIBRARIES.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BERLIN 1980. THE EUPHORIA FROM LIBRARY PLANNING IN THE 1970S
HAS NOW FADED, LEAVING BEHIND SCEPTICISM AS TO WHETHER THE PLANS CAN BE
CARRIED OUT. LIBRARY PLANNING WITHOUT A LEGAL BASIS IS NOT BINDING; THE LAW
SHOULD PROVIDE A LEGAL FRAMEWORK, LOCAL AUTHORITY PLANNING THE DETAILED
DESCRIPTION OF CONCRETE AIMS. PLANNING STAGES ARE DESCRIBED WITH REFERENCE TO
THE FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN OF 1972. LIBRARY PLANNING IS
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY; A LOCAL AUTHORITY'S
FINANCIAL CAPACITY MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO AVOID COST INFLATION.
LIBRARY PLANS CAN BE REGARDED AS PACEMAKERS ON THE WAY TO A BETTER DEVELOPMENT
OF LIBRARY SERVICES.

THIRD TIME LUCKY IN PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST?.

THE (UK) NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IS TO BE REORGANISED IN 1982 FOR THE THIRD
TIME SINCE THE WAR. THE 1974 CONCEPT OF THE HEALTH CARE DISTRICT AS A HEALTH
CARE COMMUNITY IS TO BE THE STARTING POINT OF THE NEXT REORGANISATION AND MANY
MULTI-DISTRICT AREAS ARE TO BE SPLIT, AMALGAMATED OR REGROUPED. LIBRARIANS
HAVE DEVELOPED LIBRARY SERVICES OF THE NHS AS AN INFORMATION NETWORK, AND MUCH
OF THE COUNTRY IS NOW COVERED BY REGIONAL NETWORKS INCORPORATING NHS AND
MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARIES. THE NEW DISTRICT HEALTH AUTHORITIES MAY DISRUPT OR
CUT SERVICES ALTOGETHER, NHS FAILS FREQUENTLY TO RECOGNISE THE DIRECT
CONTRIBUTION OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE, AND SOME LIBRARIES
COULD COME UNDER THE ADMINISTRATORS OF INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS, ALTHOUGH BOTH THE
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND NHS REGIONAL LIBRARIANS GROUP ADVOCATE ORGANISATION ON

PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK-TENDENCIES AND EXPECTATIONS.

THE STANDARD OF LIBRARY PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK IN WEST GERMANY IS OFTEN
CONSIDERED TO BE LOWER THAN THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. INCREASING FINANCIAL
PROBLEMS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL SOON MAKE THE LIBRARIES' TASK OF KEEPING UP
WITH MEDIA INDUSTRY TRENDS MORE DIFFICULT. IF PUBLIC LIBRARIES STILL WISH TO
BE REGARDED AS THE INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTEMPORARY WORK WITH
CULTURAL MEDIA, THEY MUST PROVIDE BETTER PUBLICITY. EACH LIBRARY HAS
INDIVIDUAL FEATURES WHICH CAN PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT IN PUBLIC RELATIONS.
LIBRARIANS MUST ESTABLISH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER LOCAL CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS, WHO WILL THEN SUPPORT CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE LIBRARY,
RESULTING IN LESS EXPENDITURE FOR THE LIBRARIAN. THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE A
'CULTURAL AGENT PROVOCATEUR', ORGANISING CULTURAL ACTIVITIES NOT ONLY TO
INCREASE LOANS BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE LIBRARY SERVICE QUALITY.

LOCAL AUTHORITY LIBRARY PLANNING CANNOT BE ABANDONED.

LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE LEGALLY BOUND TO PROVIDE LIBRARY SERVICES. THE WIDEST
POSSIBLE AREA SHOULD BE COVERED BY A LIBRARY NETWORK, INVOLVING COOPERATION
NOT ONLY WITH OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT ALSO WITH OTHER LIBRARY
ADMINISTRATORS, E.G. THE CHURCHES AND INDUSTRY. LIBRARIES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT
AS COMMUNITY MEETING-PLACES AND AS EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL CENTRES. IN MANY
AREAS MINIMUM STANDARDS OF LIBRARY PROVISION HAVE NOT YET BEEN ATTAINED. SOME
PEOPLE CALL FOR STATE LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE THE LIBRARY SERVICE BUT THIS
WOULD CAUSE TOO MANY COMPLICATIONS. CULTURAL ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE
DISTINGUISHED BY ITS AUTONOMY AND FREEDOM FROM COMPULSION BY THE STATE.

UNWANTED BOOKS ON THEM. RELATIONS BETWEEN BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIES NEED
OVERHAULING. BOOKSELLERS SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR FULFILLING LIBRARIES' BOOK
ORDERS. INCREASED FINES MAY PREVENT LOSS OF BOOKS. CLS NEED BINDING EQUIPMENT

ERGONOMICS IN LIBRARIANSHIP.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE SCIENCE OF THE STUDY OF HUMAN BEINGS IN THEIR WORKING
ENVIRONMENT, IN PARTICULAR HEALTH, LEGAL RIGHTS, AND SOCIAL ETHICS. THE
RELEVANCE TO LIBRARIANSHIP IS DEMONSTRATED BY 3 PROBLEMS' CONTINUOUS ACTIVITY

ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS IN COLLEGES OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION.

ARGUES THAT, AS A GENERALISATION, LIBRARIANS WHO REGARD THEMSELVES AS ACTING
WITHIN AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT BEHAVE RATHER DIFFERENTLY FROM THOSE WHO
STRESS THEIR LIBRARIANSHIP FUNCTIONS AND THAT THESE DIFFERENCES ARE RELATED TO
ACADEMIC STATUS. THE AWARD OF ACADEMIC STATUS ENCOURAGES THE FORMER BY
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING THOSE WILLING TO ADOPT AN EXTENDED EDUCATIONAL ROLE.
ACADEMIC RANK ALSO ELICITS THE INTERNALISATION, OR SELF-ASCRIPTION, BY THE

QUALIFIED STAFF-A BASIC FACTOR OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

VOLUNTEERS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH THE CONSTANT INCREASING
DEMANDS FROM THE READERS. THUS THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES PROFESSIONALLY
STAFFED IS STEADILY RISING AND AT PRESENT IS 4 TIMES HIGHER COMPARED TO 1957
AND THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS IS NEARLY 9 TIMES HIGHER. DURING THE
PAST 14 YEARS THE READERSHIP IN LIBRARIES RUN BY VOLUNTEERS INCREASED BY 7.5%
WHILE IN THOSE RUN BY QUALIFIED STAFF IT INCREASED BY 163%. THE NUMBER OF
LOANS IN LIBRARIES STAFFED BY PART-TIME WORKERS INCREASE TWICE WHILE IN
LIBRARIES WITH QUALIFIED STAFF IT INCREASED 4 TIMES. THESE ARE ONLY 2 EXAMPLES
OF HOW QUALIFIED STAFF CONTRIBUTED TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. HOWEVER, FOR THE TIME BEING, THE VOLUNTEERS WILL BE
MAINTAINED DUE TO THE PRESENT SITUATION.

IN SERVICE TRAINING COURSES FOR VOLUNTARY WORKERS.

IN EASTERN SLOVAKIA FROM A TOTAL OF MORE THAN 1,100 PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ABOUT
950 ARE STAFFED BY PART-TIME LIBRARIANS. THEY WORK ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS MAINLY
IN THE VILLAGES. ON AVERAGE 50% ARE TEACHERS FROM LOCAL SCHOOLS. IN SPITE OF
THEIR DEDICATION AND HARD WORK, THE VOLUNTEERS OFTEN LACKED THE NECESSARY
KNOWLEDGE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. FOR THAT REASON,
REGULATIONS, ISSUED BY THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF CULTURE IN 1976, IMPOSED THE
DUTY ON DISTRICT LIBRARIES TO MAKE PROVISIONS FOR IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF THE
SAID LIBRARIANS, RANGING FROM 8 TO 24 HOURS PER YEAR. SO FAR, THE SYLLABUSES
OF SUCH SHORT COURSES AS WELL AS TEACHING METHODS HAVE VARIED CONSIDERABLY. IN
ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL LECTURES, DISCUSSIONS AND ROLE PLAYING, FOR
INSTANCE, ARE TO BE USED MORE WIDELY. MORE PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH SLOVAK
AND FOREIGN LITERATURE (BELLES-LETTRES, FICTION) AND ALSO A GREATER INSIGHT
INTO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ADULTS WILL NO DOUBT,  EXERCISE FAVOURABLE INFLUENCE ON
THE LIBRARIAN'S PERFORMANCE, WHICH, IN TURN, WILL RESULT IN EXPANSION OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARY AND ITS SERVICES.

DEFINITIONS AND A FURTHER 30,000 SUBJECT TERMS NOT YET STANDARDISED, THROUGH
THE WORK OF OVER 100 COMMITTEES. THE ONLY WAY TO PRODUCE A CLEAR,
COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF THEIR WORK WOULD BE BY CONSTRUCTING A TERMINOLOGY DATA
BANK WHICH MUST PROVIDE ACCESS POSSIBILITIES FOR TERMS AND SOURCES, REFERENCES
TO SYNONYMS, DISCARDED TERMS AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE EQUIVALENTS, LINKS WITH THE
DINST ALTERATION SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE IN THE COMPILATION OF SUBJECT

INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY: SUBSTITUTE OR SUPPORT FOR THE HUMAN
COMPONENTS?.

DISCUSSION ABOUT OR APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IS HINDERED BY PEOPLE'S
ATTITUDES TO IT, RANGING FROM THE OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC TO THE PROFOUNDLY
SUSPICIOUS. MEN SEEM TO HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY COMPUTERS, SO THE HUMAN FACTOR
IN TECHNOLOGY IS NEGLECTED. DATA BASES MUST, HOWEVER, BE ORIENTED TOWARDS
MAN'S NEEDS, AND DIALOGUE SYSTEMS ARE MEANT FOR MACHINES AND MEN; HUMAN
INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN MACHINES AND USERS WILL BE NEEDED FOR A LONG TIME. ALL
SCIENTISTS SEARCH THEIR OWN STOCK OF INFORMATION BEFORE USING OTHER SOURCES;
AT PRESENT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN OR ANALYSIS OF THESE SMALL, INFORMAL
STOCKS. CONNECTION OF LARGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS WOULD SHOW RESPECT FOR THE HUMAN COMPONENTS. THE INFORMAL HUMAN
EXCHANGE OF OPINION AND THE HUMAN BRAIN'S ABILITY TO CREATE CROSS-CONNECTIONS
IN INFORMATION ARE STILL ESSENTIAL.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN ZAMBIA, ACQUISITIONS ARE CENTRALISED, WHICH CAN LEAD
TO UNSUITABLE SELECTION FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY RECEIVES
MOST FUNDS, WHILE OTHER LIBRARIES SUFFER, AND THERE ARE FEW GOOD BOOKSHOPS.
INTERLENDING IS FOCUSED ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, AND ATTEMPTS TO
CREATE A NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE HAVE FAILED SO FAR. DEMAND FOR BOOKS IS
HIGH, BUT LIBRARIANS' STATUS IS LOW. INTERLENDING COULD BE BASED ON EXISTING
RESEARCH COLLECTIONS, BUT A CENTRAL COLLECTION OF JOURNALS WOULD BE COSTLY AND

INTERNATIONAL REQUESTS ARE ROUTED VIA THE UNIVERSITY OF WEST INDIES LIBRARY TO
THE BLLD FOR JOURNALS, BUT TO A WIDER SELECTION OF LIBRARIES FOR MONOGRAPHS.
THE CHOICE IS DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING FOR MONOGRAPH REQUESTS, AND

GROUP PROCESSING OF LITERATURE.

LARGE LIBRARIES ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THEIR CATALOGUES AND,
AT THE SAME TIME, TO SIMPLIFY THE RETRIEVAL OF INDIVIDUAL INDEXED ITEMS. THE
BULK OF LIBRARY STOCK MUST BE INDEXED INDIVIDUALLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS A
CERTAIN TYPE OF LITERATURE, SUCH AS INFORMATION LEAFLETS, PROMOTIONAL
LITERATURE, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR GROUP PROCESSING (1 CATALOGUE CARD IS USED
FOR A SERIES OF ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE). THE MAIN LIBRARY OF LENINGRAD POLYTECHNIC
PREPARED 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR GROUP PROCESSING OF INFORMATION LITERATURE' IN
1977. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS IS DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT
GROUP PROCESSING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE CAN CONSIDERABLY INCREASE THE

SAP-A NEW WAY TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS.

WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT (SAP), AT LUND UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY, SWEDEN, A NEW VERSION OF ON-LINE CATALOGUE FOR MONOGRAPHS HAS BEEN
DEVELOPED. USING THE SAP-INDEXING METHOD, EXISTING BIBLIOGRAPHIC CATALOGUE
RECORDS HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITH SELECTED TERMS FROM CONTENTS TABLES AND BOOK
INDEXES. THE IDEA OF SAP IS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS TAKEN
FROM THE BOOKS THEMSELVES AND TO MAKE MORE USE OF A PUBLICATION'S 'INHERENT'
ATTRIBUTES. IT IS ALSO AN APPROACH TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF CLASSIFICATION
SYSTEMS IN DESCRIBING A BOOK'S CONTENTS BY MEANS OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF
CLASSIFICATION CODES. BY SAP, LOW COST RETRIEVAL CAPABILITIES ARE PROVIDED FOR
MONOGRAPH USERS.

BY A COMMITTEE ATTACHED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE'S COMMISSION FOR
ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING. TERMS USED IN RAK WERE REPLACED WITH SIMILAR ONES
FROM THE WORLD OF MUSIC AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. DURING THE PREPARATION PERIOD
SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS APPEARED WHICH WERE USED IN COMPILING THE RULES. THE ISBD
(INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION) FOR NON-BOOK MATERIAL WAS
PUBLISHED IN PARTS BETWEEN 1977-79. ALTHOUGH THE SECTION ON SOUND RECORDINGS
WAS NOT DETAILED ENOUGH, THE ISBD (PRINTED MUSIC) WAS SO COMPLEX THAT ONLY
SOME PARTS WERE SELECTED FOR INCLUSION. IN FUTURE THE RAK MUSIC RULES SHOULD

WILL VIEWDATA SYSTEMS BE USED IN EDUCATION?.

AN INTRODUCTION TO VIEWDATA SYSTEMS IS PROVIDED AS A BASIS FOR STUDYING THEIR
POTENTIAL FOR EDUCATIONAL USE. THE BBC ARE ALREADY CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS TO
USE CEEFAX IN EDUCATION AND COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO FALL AS APPLICATION BECOMES
MORE WIDESPREAD. VIEWDATA SYSTEMS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE VERSATILE AND WILL
PROBABLY BE USED MOST IN SPECIALISED EDUCATION RATHER THAN THE MORE GENERAL
FIELD. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS SHOULD INCLUDE MICROPROCESSOR-CONTROLLED TERMINALS
CONNECTED IN CLUSTERS OVER A SINGLE TELEPHONE LINE, IMPROVED GRAPHICS
FACILITIES, AND THE LINKING OF SMALL IN-HOUSE SYSTEMS TO THE NATIONAL PRESTEL
NETWORK AS MORE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ACQUIRE THEIR OWN COMPUTERS.

HOME VIDEOTEX SERVICES' SOME LEGAL ISSUES.

REVISED VERSION OF PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE, NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN
CANADIAN COMMUNICATIONS LAW AND POLICY, OTTAWA, JAN 80. THE PROVISION OF
VIDEOTEX SERVICES RAISES INTERESTING LEGAL ISSUES. THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK OF
REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO RADIO, TELEVISION, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS WILL
LIKELY APPLY TO VIDEOTEX, ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS MAY WELL
BE REGULATED DIFFERENTLY. IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THE COPYRIGHT LAW IN CANADA
COVERS INFORMATION STORED IN COMPUTERS SUCH AS THAT WHICH WOULD BE CONTAINED
IN A VIDEOTEX SYSTEM. VIDEOTEX SERVICES ORIGINATING OUTSIDE CANADA WOULD BE
ABLE TO SIDESTEP CANADIAN PRIORITIES AND CANADIAN LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS. IT
HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT A WAY OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM WOULD BE TO REGULATE
THE FLOW OF DATA ACROSS NATIONAL BORDERS.

ON THE INTRODUCTION OF VIEWDATA IN THE FIELD OF INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION.
PART 1.

'BILDSCHIRMTEXT' (BTX) IS A VIEWDATA SYSTEM SIMILAR TO PRESTEL WHICH IS BEING
DEVELOPED IN WEST GERMANY BY THE FEDERAL POST OFFICE. BTX REGISTERED USERS
WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER THE SYSTEM BY TELEPHONE. A COLOUR TELEVISION SCREEN AS A
DISPLAY DEVICE AND AN INSTRUMENT WITH A DIGITAL KEYBOARD WILL ALSO BE
NECESSARY. INFORMATION PROVIDERS WILL NEED A KEYBOARD SIMILAR TO THAT OF A
TYPEWRITER WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS TO OBTAIN GRAPHICS. AT PRESENT THE
SYSTEM IS MAINLY ORIENTED TO USERS WITH DIGITAL KEYBOARDS WHICH MEANS THAT ALL
INFORMATION HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH NUMERICAL IDENTIFICATION.
FACILITY SELECTION IS MADE THROUGH AN INDEX PROCESS PREPARED BY THE USER. THE
PROCEDURE COULD BE SPEEDED UP BY CREATING A USERS' CATALOGUE SUCH AS PRESTEL
PROVIDES. IF BTX STORAGE FACILITIES ARE EXPANDED AND THE SPEED OF ACCESS IS
IMPROVED IT SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL POSSIBILITIES FOR CONNECTING GENERAL AND
T ECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO INTEGRATE THIS NEW
SERVICE WITHOUT DUPLICATING EXISTING INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SERVICES.

ALTERNATIVE TO THE UK SERIAL ALPHA-MOSAIC AND FRENCH PARALLEL ALPHA-MOSAIC
CODING SYSTEMS. INTRINSIC DIFFERENCES IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF TELIDON HAVE
CREATED A QUITE DIFFERENT COMMUNICATION MEDIUM. NEW DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH

200,000 TO 500,000 COPIES FAIL TO SATISFY DEMAND. INTERLIBRARY LOANS AND
PROVIDING LIBRARIES WITH SUPPLEMENTARY COPIES OF POPULAR BOOKS COULD FURNISH
BETTER SATISFACTION. BOOKSELLERS, LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY-USERS SHOULD HELP TO
DETERMINE SIZE OF EDITIONS. THE MEDIA, READERS AND LIBRARIANS SHOULD PERSUADE
THE PUBLIC THAT READING BOOKS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN COLLECTING THEM.
INFORMATION USED ONCE ONLY COULD APPEAR IN 'TELEJOURNALS'. SOME PUBLISHERS
SHOULD PRODUCE MULTI-MILLION, MODERATELY PRICED EDITIONS OF CLASSIC AND MODERN
LITERATURE FOR HOME USE, WHILE OTHERS PROVIDED LARGE STOUTLY-BOUND EDITIONS

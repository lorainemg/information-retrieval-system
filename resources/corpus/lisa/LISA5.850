ULRICH'S REFERENCES TO MICROFORM AVAILABILITY.

ATTEMPTING TO USE ULRICH'S INTERNATIONAL PERIODICALS DIRECTORY AS A GUIDE TO
THE AVAILABILITY OF MICROFORM OF MANY JOURNALS CAN BE MISLEADING. A QUICK

THE DEUTSCHE STAATSBIBLIOTHEK AS A CENTRE FOR INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND UNION
CATALOGUING.

IN THE 1970S THE LIBRARY FOUNDED A SPECIAL INSTITUTE TO COPE WITH
INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND UNION CATALOGUING. THE INSTITUTE'S WORK HAS INCLUDED
ACCELERATING ORDERING PROCEDURES, ORGANISING COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT AND
INTERNATIONAL INTER-LOAN SCHEMES, IMPROVING STAFF QUALIFICATIONS, SOLVING
LEGAL PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING, KEEPING
CATALOGUES UP TO DATE AND DEVELOPING A COURIER SERVICE. SINCE 1978 STATISTICS
HAVE BEEN COMPILED ON THE 400 LIBRARIES INVOLVED IN TELETEXT SERVICES. CURRENT

TRANSPORT SCHEMES FOR INTERLIBRARY LENDING' THE UK EXPERIENCE.

WHERE POSTAL SERVICES ARE SLOW, UNRELIABLE OR EXPENSIVE, DEDICATED TRANSPORT
SCHEMES FOR INTERLENDING PURPOSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; THEIR USEFULNESS WILL
VARY FROM 1 COUNTRY TO ANOTHER, ACCORDING TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THE UK,
FEASIBILITY STUDIES WERE FOLLOWED BY THE SETTING UP OF TRANSPORT SCHEMES IN A
NUMBER OF THE UK LIBRARY REGIONS, AND A NATIONAL SCHEME LINKING THE REGIONS
WAS ENVISAGED. TRANSPORT SCHEMES WERE NOT CONSIDERED WORTHWHILE IN THE LARGER
REGIONS WITH LESS INTERLENDING ACTIVITY. A METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING UP SCHEMES
HAS BEEN DEVISED. THE PRESENT TRANSPORT SCHEMES ARE FINANCIALLY COMPETITIVE
AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO. UK EXPERIENCE MIGHT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING
POTENTIAL SCHEMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION SERVICES.

COMMENTS ON A REPORT BY THE DELEGATION FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION PROVISION' 2INFORMATION AT ANY PRICE' ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION
SERVICES1, IN WHICH IT IS SUGGESTED THAT INTERLENDING FROM SCIENTIFIC
LIBRARIES SHOULD BE CHARGED AT A STANDARD RATE PER LOAN, DESPITE THE FACT THAT
CHARGING FOR TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE COMMISSION'S
REMIT. 1 REASON FOR CONSIDERING CHARGES NONETHELESS IS THE INCREASING SCOPE
AND COST OF INTERLENDING. ANOTHER IS THE CHANGE IN THE BUDGETING OF
INSTITUTIONS FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION WHICH HAS TRANSFERRED LIBRARY ALLOCATIONS
FROM THE STATE TO THE INSTITUTIONS; THESE ARE TEMPTED TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS
THROUGH CHARGES ON INTERLENDING. THE REPORT REGARDS INTERLENDING OF LITTLE
IMPORTANCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO CALCULATE THE COST OF
INTERLENDING, NOR THE COST OF ADMINISTERING A SYSTEM OF CHARGES.

INTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS.

INTERLENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS IS BASED ON A NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR THE SUPPLY
OF SCHOLARLY LITERATURE AND A REGIONAL SYSTEM FOR SUPPLYING A WIDER RANGE OF
MATERIAL MAINLY BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 725,000 REQUESTS WERE MADE IN 1979.
MOST REQUESTS ARE SATISFIED THROUGH UNION CATALOGUES OR PRINTED UNION LISTS.
IN ADDITION TO THE 12 PROVINCIAL CENTRES, THE 13 REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIES
HAVE A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE REGIONAL SUPPLY SYSTEM; THEY RECEIVED 131,708
REQUESTS IN 1980 AND SATISFIED 27%. A SINGLE CENTRE IN EACH REGION IS
RECOMMENDED. A SURVEY OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM SHOWED THAT 40% OF ALL REQUESTS
AT THIS LEVEL CAME FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, 40% FROM SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND 20%
FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. MOST REQUESTS ARE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (60%), FOR
ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL (55% OF ALL REQUESTS; 70% OF REQUESTS FOR JOURNALS),
AND FOR MORE RECENT MATERIAL (65% PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS). THE
SATISFACTION RATE WAS 76% (HIGHER FOR REQ UESTS SENT TO UNION CATALOGUES): 1/2
WERE SUPPLIED IN 2 WEEKS, 2/3 IN 3 WEEKS IMPORTANT GAPS IN JOURNAL COVERAGE
WERE IDENTIFIED. AN ON-LINE NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN 1984
AND WILL BE USED TO DISTRIBUTE REQUESTS MORE EVENLY BETWEEN LIBRARIES, BUT
SPECIFIC GRANTS TO SUPPORT THE INTERLENDING FUNCTION IN MAJOR SUPPLYING
LIBRARIES WILL STILL BE NECESSARY, AND CHARGES SHOULD BE MADE. IMPROVED UNION
CATALOGUES ARE ENVISAGED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ALSO.

CORE COLLECTIONS OF JOURNALS FOR NATIONAL INTERLENDING PURPOSES.

CENTRALISED NATIONAL PROVISION FOR INTERLENDING PROVIDES A BETTER SERVICE THAN
DECENTRALISED PROVISION BUT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT, SO
PARTIAL CENTRALISATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. JOURNALS ARE SPECIALLY SUITED TO
CENTRAL COLLECTIONS. CONCENTRATION OF DEMAND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF
JOURNALS MEANS THAT COLLECTIONS OF 7,000-8,000 TITLES COULD SUPPLY 80% OF
DEMAND AND 2,000 TITLES 50% IN MANY COUNTRIES. THERE ARE HOWEVER PROBLEMS IN
IDENTIFYING JOURNALS FOR CORE COLLECTIONS. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE SHOWN
TO BE OF LITTLE HELP. ANALYSIS OF DEMAND AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING
DIVISION INDICATES THAT RANK LISTS ARE NOT VERY STABLE OVER TIME; AND VARIOUS
FACTORS SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR STAGE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL CAUSE
VARIATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY CORE LISTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES
(THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES, ESPECIALLY IF CORE LISTS
BASED ON CURRENT DEMAND COULD BE OBTAINED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES). ONCE A CORE COLLECTION HAD BEEN SET UP, IT WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACT
SUFFICIENT REQUESTS TO MONITOR DEMAND AND ADJUST ITS CONTENTS ACCORDINGLY. IF
A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE, LIMITATION TO CERTAIN SUBJECTS HAS
ADVANTAGES. AS COLLECTIONS GROW, ADDITIONAL JOURNALS WILL BE CHEAPER TO
ACQUIRE, THOUGH THE UNIT COST PER REQUEST WILL STILL BE LOWER FOR THE JOURNALS
IN HEAVIEST DEMAND. CONCLUDES THAT THE CONCEPT OF CORE COLLECTIONS IS SOUND,
BUT FURTHER DATA ARE NEEDED BEFORE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF SETTING UP SUCH
COLLECTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY ASSESSED.

COMPARING FICHE AND FILM' A TEST OF SPEED.

SPEEDS OF SEARCHING MICROFILM AND MICROFICHE COM CATALOGUES WERE MEASURED AND
COMPARED. SEARCHING OF MOTORISED MICROFILM CATALOGUED WAS FOUND TO BE
SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN SEARCHING MICROFICHE FOR INEXPERIENCED USERS. THE
SLOWEST FILM TIME WAS FASTER THAN MOST FICHE TIMES. RESULTS SUGGESTED,
HOWEVER, THAT FREQUENT USERS MIGHT IMPROVE THEIR SEARCHING TIMES AND MAY THEN
BE ABLE TO SEARCH FICHE FASTER THAN FILM.

THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SITUATION AND THE NATIONAL PERIODICAL CATALOGUE, (PART) 2'
THE LONG APPROACH.

THE NEED FOR A NATIONAL PERIODICAL CATALOGUE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS LONG
BEEN FELT BY REFERENCE LIBRARIANS. THE NEED WAS PARTLY FULFILLED IN 1970 WHEN
THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN GREATER COPENHAGEN PUBLISHED A CATALOGUE OF THEIR
PERIODICAL HOLDINGS. IN THE PROVINCES COVERAGE IS VERY UNEVEN AND WITH GROWTH
IN INTERLENDING THE NEED FOR A UNION CATALOGUE IS NOW ACUTE. THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
JOINT COMMITTEE IS NOW CONSIDERING A PROJECT ON SUCH A CATALOGUE AND HAS ASKED
THE LIBRARY CENTRE TO PREPARE AN EDITORIAL PLAN FOR INPUT OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DATA INTO ITS DATA BASE. IT NOW APPEARS THAT INPUT CANNOT BEGIN FOR FINANCIAL
REASONS UNTIL 1 JAN 84. APPEALS TO THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE TO INITIATE A
DEBATE ON THE PRIORITIES WITHIN THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. FOR AN ABSTRACT OF

PEOPLE SHOULD BROADEN THEIR OUTLOOK: SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD.

LIBRARIANS STILL COPE BADLY WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE NARROW CATCHWORD BECAUSE
THEIR TERMINOLOGICAL CONTROL IS STILL INEFFECTIVE. THE NARROW CATCHWORD USES
PRECISE TERMINOLOGY AND SEPARATES RELATED MATERIAL; THE BROAD CATCHWORD COVERS
WIDE SUBJECT AREAS AND TENDS TO RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF HIERARCHIES OF
SUBORDINATED GROUPS. DIE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEK (GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY) USES
MAINLY NARROW CATCHWORDS, EQUATING THIS WITH PRECISE SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION
BUT OCCASIONALLY DEVIATIONS FROM THIS PRINCIPLE OCCUR. CATCHWORDS IN SOME
SUBJECT AREAS ARE NARROWER THAN IN OTHERS. TERMINOLOGY IS CAREFULLY CONTROLLED
AND THIS IS ESSENTIAL WHEN PRECISE TERMS ARE USED. IF PRECISE SUBJECT
DEFINITION AND STRICT TERMINOLOGY CONTROL ARE CLOSELY LINKED THEN IT FOLLOWS
THAT PRECISE SUBJECT DEFINITION CAN ONLY BE CARRIED OUT IN THE USER'S INTEREST
WHEN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF WELL-TRAINED STAFF ARE AVAILABLE.

RUDOLPH FOCKE AND THE THEORY OF THE CLASSIFIED CATALOG.

BETWEEN 1900 AND 1905, RUDOLPH FOCKE PUBLISHED A SERIES OF PAPERS ON
CLASSIFICATION THEORY AND A DRAFT OF CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CLASSIFIED
CATALOGUES. HIS WORK WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE REFORM OF LIBRARIANSHIP
DURING THE LAST DECADES OF THE 19TH CENTURY. THE LARGE NUMBER OF
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USED BY GERMAN UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES WAS
SEEN AS AN OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL AND ACCESS. THE HOPE OF STANDARDISATION CAME TO NOTHING; FOCKE'S CODE
MAY EVEN HAVE HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF PERPETUATING LOCAL SYSTEMS WELL INTO
THE 20TH CENTURY. HIS WORK WAS INTRODUCED TO LIBRARIANS IN THE USA AT A TIME
WHEN SUBJECT CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION WERE IN TRANSITION. HIS CODE IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
CLASSIFICATION, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INFLUENCED BY 19TH CENTURY GERMAN
CLASSIFICATION THAN HAS HERTOFORE BEEN RECOGNISED. RE PORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM

OUTLINE OF A SOCIETY OF FREELY AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

TODAY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN MANY FIELDS CAUSE SOCIAL CHANGES ALMOST
BEFORE SOCIETY HAS BECOME AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. VERY OFTEN NEGATIVE
INFLUENCES OF CERTAIN INNOVATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED
BEFOREHAND. THIS HAS LED TO THE GROWTH OF MANY COUNTER MOVEMENTS IN SOCIETY.
IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND COMMON GROUND BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF 'ESTABLISHED'
AND 'ALTERNATIVE' STYLES OF LIVING, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF
INNOVATION IN SOCIETY. INITIATIVE, CREATIVITY AND COOPERATION, THE VITAL
FACTORS FOR TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC INNOVATION, ARE EVIDENT IN BOTH GROUPS,
ONLY OPINIONS AS TO THE BEST MEANS OF EMPLOYING THEM DIFFER. TODAY A NEW
ELECTRONIC INFORMATION NETWORK IS GRADUALLY LINKING MANKIND. THE WORLD IS
BECOMING A 'GLOBAL VILLAGE' AT LEAST ON THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL
COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURES. THIS NETWORK MAY ENABLE US TO PROGRESS TO A
RATIONAL WORLD MODEL IN WHICH EVERYONE WILL HAVE A CHANCE IN  LIFE.

READ TO THEM.

FEW PARENTS REGULARLY READ STORIES ALOUD TO THEIR CHILDREN. THE AFFECTIONATE
ATMOSPHERE GIVEN BY READING A STORY IS REASSURING AND SECURITY-BUILDING AT ANY

AND ABOUT THE WRITTEN WORD THROUGH THIS. READING TO HIM CAN HELP HIM TO
UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS HE CANNOT GRASP BY READING TO HIMSELF. LITERATURE WITH
HUMOUR, INSIGHT AND MATURITY NEEDS TO BE SOUGHT. CHILDREN FROM LITERARY RATHER

THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SITUATION AND THE NATIONAL PERIODICAL CATALOGUE, (PART) 1'
UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE LIBRARY CENTRE.

IN 1954, A BIBLIOGRAPHIC JOINT COMMITTEE WAS SET UP, WHOSE TASK WAS TO
COORDINATE DANISH BIBLIOGRAPHIC PUBLISHING AND INITIATE BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHERE
NEEDED. IT WAS TO ADVISE THE LIBRARY CENTRE THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LONG TERM
PLANNING. IN REALITY, CONTROL WAS LEFT TO THE PUBLISHERS AND INITIATIVES FOR
NEW PUBLICATIONS TO INDIVIDUALS, INTERNATIONAL BODIES AND PRESSURE GROUPS.
THIS SITUATION IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE UNTIL THE LIBRARY COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL
FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUNCIL WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR
CONTROL OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND STATE FINANCING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
AS LONG AS THE LIBRARY CENTRE HAS MONOPOLY ON PRODUCTION, IT CAN DICTATE THAT
LIBRARIES MUST PAY HIGH PRICES OR ELSE MAKE DO WITH FEWER AND INFERIOR
BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS THEREFORE CALLED FOR NATIONALISATION
OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY WITH FREE DISTRIBU TION TO LIBRARIES.

REVIEWS RECENT PROGRESS IN MODELLING HUMAN COGNITIVE PROCESSES. PARTICULAR
ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE USE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AS A FORMALISM
FOR MODELLING, AND TO COMPUTER SIMULATION OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE SYSTEMS
MODELLED. THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT DEAL AT ALL WITH NEURAL MODELS; IT FOCUSSES
MAINLY UPON HIGHER MENTAL PROCESSES, BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME ATTENTION TO
MODELLING THE ELEMENTARY PROCESSES AND ESPECIALLY TO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
ELEMENTARY AND COMPLEX PROCESSES.

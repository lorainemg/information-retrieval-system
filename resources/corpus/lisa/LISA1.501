OBSTACLES FOUND IN THE TERRAIN, THE INADEQUATE ROAD SYSTEMS, THE CULTURAL AND
LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY, THE UNEQUAL SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ITS
PEOPLE, THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONWIDE LIBRARY SERVICE, EVEN AT THE
PRIMARY SCHOOL LEVEL, AND THE SPREAD OF INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE PEOPLE'S
WAY OF LIFE AND HELPFUL IN A TIME OF URGENT CHANGE, IS AN ENORMOUS TASK. TO
SPEAK OF EXTENDING SERVICES WHERE ALMOST NONE EXIST WOULD BE TO IGNORE THE

KEEPING PEOPLE INFORMED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF PRINT. SOME PROPOSALS FOR
INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS TO ENABLE THEM TO SERVE THE

GREENLAND'S LIBRARY SERVICE THROUGH 150 YEARS.
     
1980 WAS THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF GREENLAND'S 1ST PUBLIC LIBRARY (IN THE
CAPITAL, GODTHAB) AND WAS ALSO THE YEAR IN WHICH RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
COUNTRY'S LIBRARY SERVICE PASSED FROM DENMARK TO GREENLAND'S HOME GOVERNMENT.
BRIEFLY OUTLINES THE SERVICE'S HISTORY UP TO 1956 AND DESCRIBES SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS IN GREATER DETAIL. IN 1956, A PROPER COUNTRY-WIDE SERVICE WAS
ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE DANISH-LANGUAGE CHILDREN'S BOOKS TO SUPPORT TEACHING OF
DANISH IN SCHOOLS, AND GREENLANDIC MATERIAL FOR THOSE SPEAKING ONLY THAT
LANGUAGE. THE MAIN LIBRARY IN GODTHAB (LATER DESIGNATED THE GREENLAND NATIONAL
LIBRARY) BEGAN TO BUILD A COLLECTION OF GREENLANDIC MATERIAL. THE LIBRARY
SERVICE'S MAIN HANDICAP IS THE ACUTE SHORTAGE OF MATERIAL IN GREENLANDIC.

CULTURE OF THOSE BEING STUDIED; AND A RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF
CONTEXT. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, OUTLINES SOME ETHNOGRAPHICAL

SOURCES OF ANTAGONISM TO 'QUALITATIVE' RESEARCH.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO THE
STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. CONSIDERS WHY QUANTITATIVE METHODS ARE BELIEVED
TO BE MORE 'SCIENTIFIC', RIGOROUS, AND VALID THAN QUALITATIVE ONES AND ARGUES
THAT THE TERM 'QUALITATIVE' IS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF RESEARCH WHICH
ARE SUFFICIENTLY INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE
QUANTITATIVE/QUALITATIVE DISTINCTION ARTIFICIAL. SUGGESTS THAT CRITICISMS OF
QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ARE 'IDEOLOGICAL IN THE SENSE THAT THEY GIVE SUPPORT TO

NON-TRADITIONAL STRATEGY OF EVALUATION WAS ADOPTED IN NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE
POLYTECHNIC'S TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT (SEE 77/3731). THE CLEAR-CUT
DISTINCTIONS ORIGINALLY ENVISAGED FOR THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMPONENTS OF
THE EVALUATION BECAME BLURRED AND THERE WAS CONFLICT BETWEEN PRESSURES FOR A
TRADITIONAL, TIGHTLY-CONTROLLED EVALUATION AND THE RESEARCHERS' PREFERENCE FOR
A MORE EXPLANATORY EVALUATION STRATEGY. ILLUMINATIVE EVALUATION WAS USED; THIS
ESCHEWS PRE- AND POST-TESTING IN FAVOUR OF A WIDE-RANGING STUDY OF THE
CONTEXTUAL DETERMINANTS OF A VENTURE'S SUCCESS. ITS USE POSES MANY PROBLEMS
BECAUSE IT IS A BROAD STRATEGY RATHER THAN A SET OF SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES.

FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH. APPROVES THE PROGRAMME'S STRESS ON RESEARCH
QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE LIBRARY SCHOOL STAFF. THE PROGRAMME IS THE 1ST ATTEMPT
AT A SURVEY AND ANALYSIS OF LIBRARY RESEARCH IN SWEDEN AND RIGHTLY STRESSES
THE NEED FOR DATA ON THE DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TO AND USE OF LIBRARIES BY THE
ARTS AND THE SCIENCES. BUT IT NEGLECTS AN OBVIOUS RESEARCH AREA-COOPERATION
BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY FOR EFFICIENT USE OF SCARCE RESOURCES. IN A
TIME OF ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH WHICH
MAY PROVIDE ARGUMENTS VIS-A-VIS THE GRANT GIVING AUTHORITIES FOR
'NON-QUANTIFIABLE INCOME' OR SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS. THE EMPHASIS IN THE

THE PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION OF LIBRARIANS AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL.
     
THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS HAS NOT IMPROVED IN ITALY DURING THE

ORGANISATION IN RESPECT OF RESEARCH AND TEACHING. LIBRARIANS SHOULD TAKE

LIBRARIES IN WHICH THEY INTEND TO WORK. PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION CANNOT BE
CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. LIBRARIANS LACKING
THE CAPACITY TO ORGANISE A LIBRARY ON TRADITIONAL LINES WILL NOT PROFIT MUCH

BETTER EDUCATION IN IMMIGRANT MATTERS FOR LIBRARIANS IS WANTED.
     
TRADITIONAL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES FOR ESTABLISHED USER GROUPS ARE STILL THE NORM
IN SWEDISH LIBRARIES, AND IMMIGRANT SERVICES ARE CARRIED OUT AS HUMANITARIAN
AID WITH CONSEQUENT LOW STATUS. IF DEMAND FOR IMMIGRANT LITERATURE WERE
TREATED LIKE THAT FOR COOK BOOKS OR STAMP CATALOGUES A LESS EMOTIONAL ATTITUDE
WOULD BE ACHIEVED. LIBRARIES MUST HELP IMMIGRANTS TO RETAIN THEIR MOTHER
TONGUE AS WELL AS TO LEARN SWEDISH. THERE ARE GOVERNMENTAL GUIDELINES ON
STOCKING OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AND CHANNELS OF SUPPLY ARE AVAILABLE, BUT
COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING IS NEEDED. MORE CONTACT WITH
IMMIGRANT ORGANISATIONS AND BETTER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS ARE NECESSARY. WHAT

INTERVIEW WITH N. MOORE, PROJECT OFFICER IN CHARGE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY RESEARCH
AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY. DEFINES RESEARCH AS THEORETICAL RESEARCH, WHICH
PROVIDES GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON LIBRARIES AND THEIR USERS, AND
RESEARCH WHICH SEEKS TO SOLVE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND HELP LIBRARIANS PROVIDE
BETTER SERVICES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE MAINLY INTERESTED IN THE LATTER. RECENT

ARE BEING USED TO IMPROVE SERVICES. THE BRITISH LIBRARY SUPPORTS RESEARCH
INVESTIGATING RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION, COOPERATION AND STAFF ORGANISATION IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND EXAMINING THE ROLE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO
FURTHER EDUCATION. THIS RESEARCH IS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE CARRIED OUT BY
PRACTISING LIBRARIANS, OFTEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LIBRARY SCHOOLS. THE
BRITISH LIBRARY ALSO FINANCES RESEARCH CENTRES, WHICH INITIATE RESEARCH, BUILD
UP COLLECTIONS OF RESOURCE MATERIAL AND ADVISE RESEARCHERS. AN ADVISORY COMM

FAVOUR OF INCREASING MEMBERSHIP CHARGES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN AN EFFORT TO
REDUCE GOVERNMENT SPENDING. LIBRARIANS MUST CONVINCE THE AUTHORITIES THAT
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES SHOULD BE REGARDED AS PART OF A NATIONAL INFORMATION

THE LIBRARY SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS IN DENMARK ARE GOVERNED BY THE GENERAL RULE
OF EQUAL ACCESS TO LIBRARY SERVICES. FOR PRACTICAL REASONS, THIS MEANS THAT
PART OF THE SERVICE MUST BE CENTRALISED, VIZ. SELECTION, ACQUISITION AND
PREPARATION OF THE MATERIAL. GENTOFTE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS SINCE 1970 HAD A
CENTRAL COLLECTION OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AVAILABLE TO OTHER LIBRARIES. THE
CHOICE OF MATERIAL MUST BE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT THE GROUPS AND THEIR CONDITIONS IN THE NEW COUNTRY. THE SELECTION MUST
ALSO REFLECT THE NEED, NOT ONLY FOR FICTIONAL, BUT ALSO FOR INFORMATIVE
LITERATURE BOTH ABOUT THE HOMELAND AND THE ADOPTED COUNTRY. MORE AUDIO-VISUAL

LIBRARY SERVICE TO A COMMUNITY.
     
DISCUSSES AND SUGGESTS WAYS OF CATERING FOR THE READING NEEDS OF PEOPLE IN THE
AUTHOR'S BIRTHPLACE OF TOKAINO VILLAGE, BUIN, NORTH SOLOMONS PROVINCE, PAPUA
NEW GUINEA. ITS POPULATION IS 200, MOSTLY CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS, AND MOST
CHILDREN ATTEND THE 3 LOCAL COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THERE IS NO LIBRARY SERVICE AT
PRESENT IN THE BUIN AREA, BUT THE BUIN PROVINCIAL HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVES
BOTH AS A SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARY. A PROPER PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOULD BE BUILT
IN THE TOWN CENTRE, RUN INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY, AND COMMUNITY
INFORMATION CENTRES OR MOBILE SERVICES SHOULD OPERATE IN EACH AREA, THE FORMER
STAFFED BY A LIBRARIAN AND A TEACHER. SCHOOL DROPOUTS (THE AREA HAS MANY)
COULD COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY
USE, WITH A VIEW TO POSSIBLE LIBRARY TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO WORK SUCCESSFULLY.

THE UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION.
     
THE BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION DIFFERS FROM MOST PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS IN THAT
IT IS CONCERNED WITH THE RANK-ORDER S OF THE ELEMENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR
PRODUCTIVITY (FROM HIGHEST DOWN TO LOWEST) RATHER THAN WITH THE NUMERICAL
VALUES N OF THE ELEMENT'S PRODUCTIVITY. THE DEFINING RELATIONSHIP IS THAT S IS
EXPONENTIALLY RELATED TO G, THE CUMULATIVE PRODUCTION OF THE ELEMENTS OF
RANK-ORDER S OR LESS. THIS IMPLIES A ZIPF-LIKE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEAN
PRODUCTIVITY AND RANK-ORDER, WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO THE WEBER-FECHNER LAW OF
PSYCHOPHYSICS. A VARIATIONAL SPECIFICATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS GIVEN, AND
IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
BRADFORD AND THAT OF THE USUAL DISTRIBUTIONS IS ROUGHLY ANALOGOUS TO THE

THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S TASK OF FORMING A SYSTEM RELATIVE TO THE COMPETENCE
OF THE ADVISORY AND DECISION-MAKING BODIES OF A LARGE UNIVERSITY.
     
THE FREIE UNIVERSITAT BERLIN (BERLIN UNIVERSITY) IN WEST BERLIN WAS TAKEN AS
AN EXAMPLE FOR ANALYSIS AND SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S
TASK OF FORMING A LIBRARY SYSTEM. SUCCESS IN THIS TASK DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE
LAWS GOVERNING THE LIBRARY BUT IS AFFECTED BY THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF THE
COMPETENT UNIVERSITY BODIES. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO
COORDINATE, SUPERVISE AND ADVISE THE DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES. IN ORDER TO CARRY
OUT THIS TASK THE SYSTEM PLANNING DEPARTMENT MUST BE COMPLETELY INTEGRATED
INTO THE UNIVERSITY INTERNAL INFORMATION STREAM, IT MUST BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE
INITIATIVES INTO THE ADVISORY AND DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES OF THE UNIVERSITY
AND FOLLOW THESE UP. THIS INTERDEPENDENT WORK WAS STUDIED IN DETAIL AT THE
BERLIN UNIVERSITY. WEAK POINTS IN THE SYSTEM WERE ANALYSED AND SUGGESTIONS FOR
REDUCING PREJUD ICIAL EFFECTS WERE MADE. THIS STUDY SHOULD GIVE RISE TO
INTERNAL DISCUSSION AT THE UNIVERSITY CONCERNED AND MAY ALSO BE OF INTEREST TO
OTHER EXTERNAL LIBRARIES OF SIMILAR STRUCTURE.

REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL INFORMATION SERVICE.
     
THE JAPAN MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS THE MOST POWERFUL ASSOCIATION OF
SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN JAPAN. IT OWES MUCH FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT TO THE USA AND
EUROPE, AND AS SUCH HAS VIRTUALLY NO CONTACT WITH MEDICAL LIBRARIES IN ASIAN,
AND PARTICULARLY SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES. WHILST THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN MEDICAL
INFORMATION CENTER (SEAMIC) HELD ITS 1ST WORKSHOP IN TOKYO IN 1973, THE
PROBLEM OF THE VARIETY AND COMPLEXITY OF THE REGION IS A BARRIER TO THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NETWORK OF LIBRARIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. ONLY BY REMOVING
THESE BARRIERS AND ESTABLISHING STRONG REGIONAL COOPERATION, CAN INFORMATION
BE EXCHANGED FREELY, WHICH WILL BE A SURE STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL

EFFORT NEEDS TO BE MADE TO REVIEW AND CONTROL US FEDERAL STATISTICAL POLICY.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COLLECTS STATISTICAL INFORMATION FOR REGULATION,

POLICY MUST BE EFFECTIVELY INCORPORATED INTO LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND
REGULATORY ACTIONS, WITH A STATISTICAL OFFICE REMAINING SEPARATE FROM OTHER
ASPECTS OF INFORMATION POLICY. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF
COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IN ITS DISSEMINATION AND USE OF
STATISTICAL DATA, AND PRIVATE FIRMS SHOULD ENGAGE IN ANY AND ALL ANALYSIS
APPROPRIATE FOR THE MARKETS BEING SERVED. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT

THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE AS SHOWN BY A LARGE-SCALE CITATION
ANALYSIS.
     
TO COLLECT INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SECONDARY SERVICES, AN
ANALYSIS OF 59,000 CITATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES WAS CONDUCTED-11,000 TAKEN
FROM 300 MONOGRAPHS, AND 48,000 FROM 140 SERIALS, INCLUDING 47 HIGHLY CITED
TITLES AND 47 TAKEN AT RANDOM. LARGE DIFFERENCES WERE APPARENT BETWEEN
ANALYSES OF REFERENES TAKEN FROM SERIALS AND THOSE FROM MONOGRAPHS, AND
SMALLER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANALYSES OF REFERENCES FROM HIGHLY CITED AND
RANDOMLY CHOSEN SERIALS. THERE WERE ALSO GREAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUBJECTS;
MOST OF THESE DIFFERENES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PLANNING OF SECONDARY
SERVICES. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES ARE
DEFICIENT IN THE RANGE OF FORMS OF MATERIAL THEY COVER, IN THE NUMBER AND
POSSIBLY THE SELECTION OF SERIALS COVERED, IN THE SUBJECT SPREAD OF MATERIAL
OF POSSIBLE RELEVANCE, AND PROBABLY ALSO OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE MATERIAL AND
MATERIAL PUBLISHED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.

EARLY 80S IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARY NEEDS. IN THE MID-60S, EMPHASIS
WAS ON ORDERING, AND TECHNOLOGY WAS LIMITING BOTH IN TERMS OF COSTS AND
CAPABILITIES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 80S LIBRARIES HAVE NUMEROUS ACQUISITIONS
AVAILABLE, INCLUDING TURNKEY SYSTEMS FROM SOME CIRCULATION SYSTEM VENDORS AND
THE ACQUISITIONS SUBSYSTEMS OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES. IT IS UNLIKELY

FIRST, DO NO HARM' GIVING ADVICE ABOUT PHOTO-CONSERVATION.
     
IN 1979 IN THE USA, OVER 10 BILLION EXPOSURES WERE MADE BY 45 BILLION CAMERAS,
BUT MOST OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WILL EVENTUALLY BE LOST, THROWN AWAY,
SELF-DESTRUCT OR BE FORGOTTEN BEFORE ANYONE EVEN THINKS OF PRESERVING THEM FOR
POSTERITY. MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY AMASSED TOO MANY PHOTOGRAPHS, AND SO
PERHAPS PRESERVATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE PHOTOGRAPHS' ORIGINATORS. ONLY
NOW IS SOME EFFORT BEING MADE TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMMES FOR THE FORMAL TRAINING
OF CONSERVATORS, AND MOST AMATEURS STILL WANT CHEAP, QUICK AND EASY SOLUTIONS.
IT FALLS TO LIBRARIANS, ARCHIVISTS AND CURATORS, THEREFORE TO MAKE USEFUL
INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO ASK FOR IT AND TO BE PREPARED TO
CARRY IT TO THOSE WHO DO NOT. PRESENTS A LIST OF USEFUL AND RECENT SOURCE

DISINFECTION AND STRAIGHTENING OF PARCHMENT DAMAGED BY MICROORGANISMS.
     
BACTERIA AND MICELLAR FUNGI WERE ISOLATED FROM DAMAGED PARTS OF ANCIENT
MANUSCRIPTS ON PARCHMENT AND INVESTIGATED. CATAMIN AB (ALREADY USED AS A
DISINFECTANT FOR PAINTINGS) WAS FOUND TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ANTISEPTIC
AGENT AGAINST THESE PARCHMENT-DESTROYING MICROORGANISMS AND A DISINFECTING
TECHNIQUE INCORPORATING THE STRAIGHTENING OF DEFORMED PARCHMENTS WAS
DEVELOPED. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT CATAMIN AB HAS NO DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT ON THE

ENUMERATES AND COMMENTS ON THE MANY FACTORS THAT CAUSE INCREASED NEED FOR
ACADEMIC LIBRARY SPACE. SINCE THE COLLECTION OCCUPIES ONLY FROM 25-45% OF THE
FLOORSPACE IN LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, THESE OTHER FACTORS MUST ALSO BE
STUDIED AND REMEDIED IN ORDER TO LIMIT BUILDING GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING MEASURES
TO SLOW THE INCREASE IN STORAGE SPACE ARE REVIEWED IN DETAIL' WEEDING;
ZERO-GROWTH; COMPACT STORAGE; COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS; MINIATURISATION. IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF STORED MATERIALS, DETAILED ARGUMENTS ARE
CITED WHY BROWSING IS AN INSUFFICIENT RETRIEVAL DEVICE FOR SERIOUS RESEARCH.
THE POINT IS MADE THAT A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE MEASURES IS NEEDED TO REDUCE
SPACE PRESSURES INHERITED FROM THE PAST. FURTHERMORE, IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF
THE STUDIES SHOWING THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF ACQUIRED WORKS IS RARELY IF EVER
USED, A MORE LIMITED AND REGIONALLY COORDINATED SELECTION POLICY IS NEEDED TO
REDUCE FUTURE SPACE PRESSURES.

OCT 79. A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF 3 INDIAN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS. A
GENERAL THEORY OF SUBJECT INDEXING LANGUAGE (SIL) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH
LOGICAL ABSTRACTION OF THE STRUCTURES OF OUTSTANDING SILS. THE LANGUAGE OF
POSTULATE-BASED PERMUTED SUBJECT INDEXING (POPSI) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH
THE INTERPRETATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF SILS FORMING PART OF THE GENERAL
THEORY. THE CLASSAURUS HAS ALSO BEEN FORMULATED; THIS IS A FACETED SYSTEMATIC
SCHEME OF HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION HAVING ALL THE NECESSARY ATTRIBUTES OF A
CONVENTIONAL THESAURUS, EXCLUDING THE NUMERATION OF OTHER RELATED TERMS AND IS

ONLINE LITERATURE RESEARCH AT UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF
GERMANY-A PROGRESS REPORT.
     
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMME FOR THE PROMOTION OF INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION WAS PASSED ON 17 DEC 74. THE AIM OF THE PROGRAMME WAS TO
COORDINATE AND IMPROVE ACTIVITIES IN THE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SECTOR
WHICH HAD DEVELOPED RAPIDLY IN RECENT YEARS. THE PROGRAMME CONCENTRATED ON
SETTING UP 4 SUBJECT ORIENTED DATA SYSTEMS' PATENTS, RESEARCH PROCEDURE,
ENVIRONMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL RULES. THE PROGRESS IN EACH AREA HAS BEEN
DIFFERENT. 17 LIBRARIES RECEIVED AN ON-LINE CONNECTION TO THE DIMDI (DEUTSCHE
INSITUT FUR MEDIZINISCHE DOKUMENTATION UND INFORMATION) DATA BANK IN COLOGNE
IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A PROJECT ORGANISED BY THE MINISTRY FOR RESEARCH AND
TECHNOLOGY. LIBRARIES ALSO HAD ON-LINE CONNECTIONS TO DATA BANKS FORMED BY THE
INFORMATION CENTRE FOR ENERGY, PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS. THE QUESTION OF
FINANCE IS THE LARGEST OBSTACLE TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES PROVIDING PERMANENT O
N-LINE FACILITIES FOR LITERATURE RESEARCH. ALTHOUGH SOME ON-LINE DATA SERVICES
ARE AVAILABLE TO LIBRARIES FREE OF CHARGE THE COST OF THE HARDWARE HAS TO BE
COVERED BY THE LIBRARIES.

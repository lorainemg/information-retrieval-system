THE PHILOSOPHY OF RECORDING KNOWLEDGE.
     
ALTHOUGH MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT HOW MANKIND HAS RECORDED KNOWLEDGE, THE
QUESTION OF WHY RECORD KNOWLEDGE AT ALL HAS NOT BEEN TREATED SYSTEMATICALLY.
INFERENCES AND DEDUCTIONS FROM HISTORICAL RECORDING FORMATS LEAD TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT WHILE TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED THE ART OF RECORD KEEPING, THE
UNDERLYING PURPOSES HAVE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME-TO COMMEMORATE,

LOCALLY-PRODUCED MATERIAL AND IN LOCAL HISTORY STUDIES. REQUIREMENTS FOR
IMPROVING THE SERVICE INCLUDE' (1) A MORE BALANCED GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
OF SERVICE POINTS; (2) THE REDISTRIBUTION OF SOME STOCK TO ENSURE BETTER
USAGE; (3) THE DISCOVERY, COLLECTION AND CIRCULATION OF MORE LOCAL MATERIAL;

THE CHINESE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCENE' REFLECTIONS ON A VISIT TO CHINA IN

IMPRESSIONS GAINED DURING AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHINA IN JUNE 80. CHINA HAS A
FEW VERY LARGE LIBRARIES WITH STRONG COLLECTIONS AND GENEROUS FUNDING. MANY
OTHER LIBRARIES HAVE SERIOUS GAPS IN THEIR COLLECTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION. THE EMPHASIS IS ON ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES-THERE
SEEM TO BE NO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SERVICES ARE UNDEVELOPED, BUILDINGS AND
EQUIPMENT ARE NOT OF A HIGH QUALITY, THERE IS NO PLANNED INTERLENDING SYSTEM
OR LIBRARY COORDINATION, AND MOST RESEARCH IS CONCERNED WITH AUTOMATION AND
INFORMATION SYSTEMS RATHER THAN LIBRARIANSHIP. THE CHINESE WISH TO SOLVE THEIR
PROBLEMS THEMSELVES, ALTHOUGH THEY WELCOME HELP. THE WHOLE SITUATION IS IN A
STATE OF RAPID CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT.

PARTICULAR PROBLEMS IN THE TRAINING OF HIGHER-QUALIFIED LIBRARY AND RESEARCH

MANY LIBRARY SCHOOLS SUFFER FROM HAVING TOO FEW QUALIFIED LECTURERS,

IMPROVING SIGNIFICANTLY THE FURTHER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS. THERE IS A NEED

OF USING OUTHOUSE DATA BASES (LOCKHEED DIALOG AND BLAISE MARC) WITHIN
PROGRAMMES DESIGNED TO MAKE MAXIMUM USE OF INHOUSE PACKAGES WAS INVESTIGATED.
INHOUSE PROGRAMMES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PRACTICE WORK-THE BLAISE EDITOR WOULD BE
PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TO USE. SOFTWARE FOR HANDLING MARC WAS FOUND TO BE
GENERALLY INADEQUATE. THE HEWLETT-PACKARD 2645A DISPLAY STATION WAS FOUND
ACCEPTABLE FOR TRAINING PURPOSES.

A REVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM IN EAST
AFRICA.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY SYSTEM
FAVOURED BY THE WEST IS APPLICABLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IT IS NECESSARY TO
STUDY THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN A PARTICULAR AREA, ITS
CURRENT STATUS, AND ITS PLANNED FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY
(KENYA, UGANDA, AND TANZANIA) WAS CHOSEN FOR THIS STUDY AS ITS LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY LONG TO ENABLE A CAUSE-AND-EFFECT ANALYSIS.
IN FUTURE, THERE MUST BE A BALANCE BETWEEN ACCEPTANCE OF APPOSITE WESTERN
IDEAS AND REJECTION OF THOSE IDEAS HARMFUL TO THE COMMUNITY. FINANCIAL SUPPORT
IS BECOMING MORE ASSURED; THE RECOGNITION OF LOCAL REQUIREMENTS MUST FOLLOW.

ARE MOBILE LIBRARIES A PROFITABLE MEANS OF PROVIDING LITERATURE FOR
STRUCTURALLY WEAK AREAS?.
     
LITERATURE PROVISION FOR RURAL AREAS HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT. A COMPARISON
BETWEEN MOBILE AND SMALL VILLAGE LIBRARIES SHOWS THAT MOBILE LIBRARIES ARE,
CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION, CHEAPER TO RUN; THEY HAVE LARGER AND MORE
FREQUENTLY CHANGED STOCKS AND DO NOT HAVE TO PAY OVERHEADS FOR HEATING AND
LIGHTING. VILLAGE LIBRARIES CANNOT BE CULTURAL CRYSTALLISATION CENTRES IF
THEIR STOCKS ARE INADEQUATE. CHILDREN ARE THE MAIN USERS OF VILLAGE LIBRARIES,
WHICH THEREFORE STOCK MAINLY CHILDREN'S BOOKS. MOBILE LIBRARIES CARRY A LARGER
PROPORTION OF ADULT MATERIAL; FEWER CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE NEEDED HERE SINCE THE
CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD SCHOOL LIBRARIES. GOOD QUALITY LITERATURE
PROVISION IS ALWAYS PROFITABLE AND IN CONTRAST WITH VILLAGE LIBRARIES, MOBILE
LIBRARIES ALWAYS HAVE QUALIFIED STAFF. THE TRAVELLING LIBRARY IS A GOOD
ADVERTISEMENT FOR LIBRARY SERVICES.

REPORTS ON A CONFERENCE ON LIBRARY SERVICE TO IMMIGRANTS ORGANISED BY THE
DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, MAR 81, AND HELD IN ISHOJ, WHICH HAS DENMARK'S
LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF IMMIGRANTS WITH 50 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY A
POPULATION OF 21,000. THE MAYOR OF ISHOJ ARGUED THAT IMMIGRANTS MUST
ASSIMILATE AND LEARN DANISH, WHEREAS THE 3 IMMIGRANT SPOKESMAN CLAIMED THAT
CHILDREN MUST LEARN THEIR MOTHER TONGUE PROPERLY BEFORE THEY CAN LEARN DANISH,
IF THEY ARE NOT TO BE CULTURALLY ISOLATED, KNOWING 2 LANGUAGES ONLY PARTLY.
BOOK PROVISION WAS 6 BOOKS PER DANE, BUT ONLY 1/2 PER IMMIGRANT. THE
LIBRARIANS PRESENT POINTED OUT THE ENORMITY OF THE PROBLEM OF LIBRARY
PROVISION TO IMMIGRANTS SPEAKING SO MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, AND ASKED FOR
MORE BILINGUAL LIBRARIANS AND CLOSER CONTACT WITH SCHOOLS ON MATTERS OF
LINGUISTIC BACKGROUND AND BOOK SELECTION.

THE APPLICATION OF READABILITY AND OTHER TECHNIQUES OF LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS TO
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. FINAL REPORT FOR THE PERIOD MARCH-MAY 1979.
     
13 CITIES WERE VISITED TO MEET EXPERTS ON READING, EDUCATION, PSYCHOLOGY, DATA
PROCESSING, LINGUISTICS AND LIBRARIANSHIP. SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS RESULTED
FROM THESE VISITS. THEY INCLUDE' (A) THE SETTING UP OF A VERY LOW BUDGET
RESEARCH UNIT TO COLLECT AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATION; (B) FUTURE RESEARCH ON
THE BETTER PRESENTATION OF READABILITY DATA TO TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS; (C)
MORE WORK ON THE LINGUISTIC CHANGES INVOLVED IN SUMMARISING TEXT; (D) MORE
EMPHASIS ON WHAT THE READER DOES WITH INFORMATION RETRIEVED, ESPECIALLY IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES; AND (E) INVESTIGATION OF EDUCATION IN THE USE OF LITERATURE

LIBRARY USE IN AN URBAN BLACK COMMUNITY IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE READING, PUBLIC
LIBRARY USE AND COMMUNICATIONS HABITS OF A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 406 HOUSEHOLDS AND

PROFICIENCY IN READING AS A CRITERION FOR A GENERAL TYPOLOGY OF READERS.
     
SOME KIND OF CLASSIFICATION OF READERS IS NECESSARY FOR THE COMPLEX EDUCATION
OF LIBRARY USERS. MUCH PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IMPOSED TOO RIGID DISTINCTIONS
BETWEEN READERS OF FICTION AND NONFICTION. A MORE RELEVANT DIVISION WOULD BE
ACCORDING TO PROFICIENCY IN DIFFERENT READING SKILLS' CHOOSING BOOKS TO READ;
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS READ; ACQUIRING AND USING THE INFORMATION CONTAINED. 6

A PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL BASIS FOR CLASSIFYING READERS.
     
IN ORDER TO DEVELOP READING ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE ABLE
TO CATEGORISE HIS READERS. THIS CAN BE DONE BY A PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL METHOD,
CONSIDERING BOTH THE ACTUAL READING ABILITY AND MOTIVES OF THE READER.
'READING ABILITY' SHOULD TAKE ACCOUNT OF' DIRECTION IN READING
(PURPOSIVENESS); ABILITY TO SELECT BOOKS; AND ABILITY TO ABSORB CONCEPTUAL
CONTENT. READERS' MOTIVES ARE DIVIDED INTO' THOSE WHOSE READING IS DIRECTED
TOWARDS DEVELOPING THEIR SOCIAL AND MORAL OUTLOOK; THOSE WHO NEED HELP IN
CHOOSING A CAREER; THOSE WHO READ TO DEVELOP THEIR PERSONALITY; BUT FURTHER
SUB-DIVISIONS MAY ALSO BE WORKED OUT.

THE ADVANCEMENT OF READING AT WORK.
     
THE FACTORY LIBRARY SHOULD PROVIDE LITERATURE FOR ALL STAFF, ESPECIALLY THE
WORKERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE READING HABITS
OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS; WORKERS PROBABLY COMPRISE MORE THAN 1/8 BUT LESS
THEN 1/2 OF A FACTORY LIBRARY'S READERS. THE FACTORY LIBRARY IS THE LIBRARY
MOST LIKELY TO PROMOTE READING AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES. IN FACTORY
LIBRARIES, AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THERE ARE MORE ADULT READERS THAN
TEENAGE READERS AND MORE MALE READERS THAN FEMALE. MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT
ADULTS NEED TO READ MORE THAN THE YOUNG AND THAT THE WORKERS WHO DO READ, EVEN
IF ONLY LIGHT LITERATURE, WILL HAVE MORE ACTIVE AND COMMUNICATIVE
PERSONALITIES THAN NON-READERS AND MAKE A LARGER CONTRIBUTION TO PRODUCTIVITY.

HIGHER FOR PATENTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAN FOR A

TECHNICALLY IMPORTANT PRODUCTS, WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS FREQUENTLY CITED AS A
RANDOMLY SELECTED SET OF 102 CONTROL PATENTS. THIS FINDING PROVIDES STRONG
EVIDENCE FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PATENT CITATION DATA CAN BE USED IN

URGENT IT IS TO BUILD UP REGIONAL DATA PROCESSING NETWORKS FOR COOPERATIVE
CATALOGUING IN LIBRARIES. REGIONAL NETWORKS PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL MEANS OF
RATIONALISING LIBRARY WORK. THESE NETWORKS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUCTED IN ALL 11
FEDERAL STATES BUT SHOULD BE BUILT UP ON THE EXISTING 7 LENDING SYSTEM
REGIONS; THEY WOULD ALL BE CONNECTED IN A NATIONAL NETWORK. REGIONAL LIBRARY
CENTRES WOULD FORM THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERAL
TASK AREAS' CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITION, CENTRAL EDITING OF CATALOGUES ETC.,

DO LIBRARIES HAVE POLITICAL DUTIES?.
     
MANY TASKS UNDERTAKEN BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE POLITICAL, NOT BECAUSE THEY
PROMOTE PARTY POLITICS BUT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE ENLIGHTENMENT AND PLEASURE FOR
EACH INDIVIDUAL IN A FREE DEMOCRACY. CULTURE INVOLVES NOT ONLY BEAUTY BUT ALSO
SOCIAL REALITY. LIBRARIANS MUST HELP ALL HANDICAPPED PEOPLE; GERMANY IS AHEAD
OF FRANCE IN LIBRARY WORK WITH THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED AND PROVISION OF
LIBRARY FACILITIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS CERTAINLY INVOLVES BOTH CULTURE AND
POLITICS. THE LIBRARIES MUST PROMOTE READING, OR BOOKS MAY BE OUSTED BY
AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA. STOCK SELECTION CRITERIA MUST BE THOSE OF TRUTH AND
OBJECTIVITY; THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE MINDFUL OF ALL VIEWPOINTS, SINCE FREEDOM
PERMITS OPPOSITION.

THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC ('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LIBRARIES AFTER THE NEW
POLYTECHNIC (UNIVERSITY) LAWS.
     
IN 1979 NEW UNIVERSITY LAWS WERE PASSED WHICH AFFECTED POLYTECHNIC
('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LAWS AND THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES.
ALTHOUGH POLYTECHNICS DIFFER IN FORM SLIGHTLY FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER WITHIN
WEST GERMANY, THERE ARE SOME GENERAL POINTS IN THE NEW LAWS WHICH INFLUENCE
POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN THE SAME WAY. THE STATUS OF THE LIBRARIES HAS BECOME
MORE PRECISE; THEY ARE RECOGNISED AS CENTRAL WORKING UNITS. THE LIBRARIES NOW
HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS CONCERNING BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND THE
ALLOCATION OF NEW STAFF. THE POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY HAS THUS BECOME AN
INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION WITH ITS OWN DUTIES AND RIGHTS WITHIN THE POLYTECHNIC.
HOWEVER, LIBRARIES STILL DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF ALLOCATIONS FROM THE CENTRAL
POLYTECHNIC BODIES. FINAL DECISIONS ON THE CHOICE OF LITERATURE ACQUISITION
CAN STILL ONLY BE MADE BY THE RELEVANT POLYTECHNIC DEPARTMENT WITH THE LI
BRARY MERELY ACTING IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY.

EFFECTIVENESS. THIS IS USUALLY MEASURED IN TERMS OF LOAN FIGURES, BUT THIS
METHOD FAILS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF REFERENCE AND INFORMATION WORK, NOW OF GROWING
IMPORTANCE. EFFECTIVENESS MUST BE SEEN IN RELATION TO THE LIBRARY'S AIMS. A
MANUAL FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS PUBLISHED IN 1976 BY
THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. FOR THOSE LIBRARIES WHICH ACTIVELY PROMOTE
MATERIALS TO CREATE DEMANDS, HAMBURG ET AL (1972) SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING TESTS
FOR EFFECTIVENESS' EXPOSURE COUNTS, ITEM USE-DAYS, EXPOSURE TIME. GORE (1978)
USES THE HOLDINGS RATE, AVAILABILITY RATE, AND PERFORMANCE RATE, THE LATTER
MEASURING THE PERCENTAGE OF REQUIRED MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHEN WANTED BY USER.

MEASUREMENT IS COMPLEX, BUT THAT RELYING ON LOAN FIGURES ONLY IS NO LONGER

SAVE! THAT MEANS AGAIN FEWER BOOKS.
     
THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE HAS EXAMINED PUBLIC LIBRARY ACCOUNTS FOR 1981. THESE
SHOW AN OVERALL INCREASE WELL WITHIN THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR'S LIMIT OF 2% REAL
GROWTH. BECAUSE OF BOOK PRICE RISES, ACQUISITIONS ARE LIKELY TO SHOW AN
OVERALL FALL OF 4%. THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR URGED LIBRARIES TO SPEND NOT MORE
THAN 185 KR. PER INHABITANT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT EFFECT THIS
STATEMENT HAS HAD, BUT A CLOSER EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT THE HIGHEST SPENDERS,
ALL IN THE COPENHAGEN AREA, HAVE CUT DOWN MOST. IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
PART-TIME LIBRARIES SHOW LARGER PERCENTAGE INCREASES THAN FULL-TIME LIBRARIES.
ONLY THE SOUTHERN JUTLAND REGION SHOW A CONSIDERABLE REAL INCREASE IN
EXPENDITURE ON MATERIALS. AS STAFF SALARIES ARE SUBJECT TO TOPPING UP IF

REFERENCE SERVICES AS A TEACHING FUNCTION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. REVIEWS SOME OF

LIBRARIANS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD WITHIN THE US LIBRARY PROFESSION.

JUSTIFYING THEIR FUNCTIONS AND THAT A SUITABLE WAY OF DOING THIS WOULD BE FOR
THE LIBRARY TO BECOME A 'TEACHING LIBRARY'.

(THE JANET DOE LECTURE ON THE HISTORY OR PHILOSOPHY OF MEDICAL LIBRARIANSHIP,
PRESENTED JUNE 17, 1980 AT THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C.) IF LIBRARIANS ARE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE AND

CUSTODIANS OR INFORMATION SERVICE MANAGERS. THERE ARE MANY APPROACHES TO THIS
UNDERSTANDING INCLUDING THE HISTORICAL, SOCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND
EPISTEMOLOGICAL. IT CAN ALSO BE SOUGHT THROUGH A STUDY OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF
KNOWLEDGE AND A STUDY OF THE WAYS IN WHICH CHANGES IN COMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGY IN WRITING AND PRINTING HAVE AFFECTED SCHOLARSHIP IN THE PAST. THIS

A PROPOSED OUTPATIENT DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED AND COMPARED WITH
THE CURRENT SYSTEM. 4 MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED.
1ST, THE NEW OUTPATIENT DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM COULD SIMPLIFY AND REDUCE
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. 2ND, THE NEW DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM COULD PROVIDE A
TOOL FOR ASSESSING THE CURRENT STATE OF READINESS OF OPERATIONAL UNITS
THROUGHOUT THE NAVY. 3RD, THIS SYSTEM COULD BE USED AS A BASIS FOR MAKING
PREDICTIONS CONCERNING STAFFING AND MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS OF ANY MEDICAL
FACILITY UNDER A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS. FINALLY, THE PROPOSED OUTPATIENT
SYSTEM COULD BE TIED TO THE CURRENT INPATIENT SYSTEM TO DERIVE COMPLETE
MEDICAL HISTORIES FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. BY MERGING THE 2 DATA SYSTEMS A
RESEARCH TOOL WOULD BE CREATED THAT COULD PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS WITH AN
UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT, DISTRIBUTION, CAUSES,

BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON D.C., 18 JUNE 80. PRESENTS THE METHODS AND RESULTS OF
A STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO DISCOVER HOW EFFECTIVE FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY GROUPS ARE
AS SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR US MEDICAL RARE BOOK LIBRARIES. CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE MEDICAL RARE BOOK LIBRARY AND OF FRIENDS GROUPS WERE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY
THOSE WHICH ARE CORRELATED WITH SUCCESSFUL FRIENDS GROUPS. CORRELATIONS WERE
FOUND BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY CONTRIBUTED BY THE FRIENDS GROUP AND THE AGE
OF THE GROUP; THE LIBRARIAN'S PARTICIPATION IN FORMING IT; AND THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY SPENT BY THE LIBRARY ON THE GROUP. RECOMMENDS WAYS OF INCREASING THE
LEVEL OF DONATIONS FROM FRIENDS GROUPS, AND OF MANAGING THESE FUNDS MORE

THE CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION AS TO WHETHER PUBLISHERS SHOULD BE LEGALLY REQUIRED
TO SUPPLY DEPOSITORY COPIES FREE OF CHARGE TO LIBRARIES IS ONCE AGAIN BEING
DISCUSSED IN WEST GERMANY. SOME PUBLISHERS IN BADEN-WURTTEMBERG CHALLENGED
THIS REQUIREMENT AND TOOK THEIR CASE BEFORE THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.
AN AMENDED LAW WAS PASSED IN BADEN-WURTTEMBERG AS A RESULT OF THIS ACTION
WHEREBY PUBLISHERS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO SUPPLY 1 COPY FREE OF CHARGE BUT CAN
BE RECOMPENSED FOR UP TO 50% OF THEIR COSTS FOR ANY FURTHER COPIES. IN THE
LIGHT OF THE CONSTITUTION DELIVERING DEPOSITORY COPIES IS TO BE SEEN AS A
SOCIAL DUTY DIRECTLY LINKED TO PROPERTY OWNERSHIP. THE PUBLISHER HAS A DUTY TO
THE PUBLIC TO SUPPLY LIBRARIES WITH CURRENT LITERATURE BUT A BALANCE MUST BE
STRUCK BETWEEN THIS AND THE FINANCIAL LIMITS OF THE PUBLISHER.

THE PRINCIPLES FOR THE PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS ARE

SECTION. THE AIM OF THE PRINCIPLES IS TO INCREASE LIBRARY STAFF'S AWARENESS OF
THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING AND RESTORING NOT ONLY ARCHIVE MATERIAL BUT ALSO
CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE COLLECTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IS THAT OF
SUITABLE STORAGE FACILITIES. MOST COMMON FORMS OF DAMAGE OCCUR THROUGH
UNSTABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, INCORRECT LIGHTING, DUST, BIOLOGICAL CAUSES
(MICRO-ORGANISMS AND INSECTS) AND CHEMICAL CAUSES (OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS OF
THE CELLULOSE). TO PROTECT ORIGINAL MATERIAL, COPIES SHOULD BE LENT TO THE
USER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. RESTORATION SHOULD ONLY BE CARRIED OUT WHEN IT IS
UNAVOIDABLE. EVERY STEP OF THE RESTORATION PROCESS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED AS
LIBRARIANS SHOULD REALISE THAT EVEN EXPERT RESTORATION CAN LEAD TO
FALSIFICATION AND DISTORTION OF THE ORIGINAL .

HEINSIUS, KAYSER AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
NO HISTORICAL NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR GERMAN LITERATURE EXISTS; INSTEAD
GREAT IMPORTANCE IS PLACED ON THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORKS COMPILED BY HEINSIUS
AND KAYSER IN THE 18TH CENTURY. THESE ARE WIDELY USED AS REFERENCE
BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND THE VALIDITY OF THEIR ENTRIES IS RARELY QUESTIONED.
HEINSIUS AND KAYSER BASED THEIR CATALOGUES ON BIBLIOGRAPHIES PUBLISHED BY THE
BOOK TRADE SUCH AS EXHIBITION CATALOGUES. THESE WERE OFTEN INCOMPLETE AND DID
NOT INCLUDE REPRINTS OR NEW EDITIONS. THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT
REFERENCES IN THE CATALOGUES AND A COMPLETE STUDY OF THE WORKS OF HEINSIUS AND
KAYSER IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS RELIABLE REFERENCE MATERIAL AND WHAT
IS NOT. A GUIDE TO USING THE CATALOGUES WHICH LISTED THE CHANGING

OF HOW STUDENTS AND CHILDREN SEQUENCE WORDS AND RETRIEVE ITEMS FROM INDEXES
WITH DIFFERENT SEQUENCES. CONCLUDES THAT STUDENTS USE A VARIETY OF METHODS
WHEN ASKED TO PUT WORDS IN ORDER FOR AN INDEX, WITH SENSE AND MEANING BEING A
PRIME CONSIDERATION. SCHOOLCHILDREN, HOWEVER, WERE FOUND TO BE LESS AMBITIOUS
IN THIS RESPECT, AND TO ORDER WORDS ALPHABETICALLY USING THE LETTER BY LETTER
METHOD. NO 1 METHOD OF SEQUENCING INDEXES WAS FOUND TO LEAD TO BETTER

THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING PRECIS WITH EXTRA FACILITIES TO ENABLE IT TO
FUNCTION AS A SYSTEM FOR SWITCHING INDEXING DATA BETWEEN 2 OR MORE NATURAL
LANGUAGES WAS INVESTIGATED. LEXICONS WERE ESTABLISHED IN 3 LANGUAGES, AND A
'PIVOT FILE' CREATED TO LINK THEM. ROUTINES FOR SWITCHING INDEXING TERMS OUT
OF A GIVEN SOURCE LANGUAGE AND INTO A CHOSEN TARGET LANGUAGE WERE DEVISED AND
SET DOWN IN THE FORM OF FLOW-CHARTS OR ALGORITHMS. USING THESE ALGORITHMS,
PRECIS STRINGS WERE SWITCHED MAINLY BETWEEN ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND GERMAN.
PROBLEMS OF TRANSLATION WERE SOLVED BY THE USE OF 'LEXICAL BLOCKS' AND THE
ADOPTION OF A SYSTEM OF CATEGORIES. MECHANISMS FOR THE AUTOMATIC PROVISION OF
ARTICLES IN FRENCH AND GERMAN STRINGS WERE DESIGNED. 2 METHODS OF PROVIDING
INFLECTED FORMS OF NOUNS BY ALGORITHM WERE TESTED IN GERMAN AND POLISH. THE
USE OF 'SUBSTITUTE' PHRASES IN PRECIS WAS INVESTIGATED, AND PROCEDURES FOR THE
AUTOMATIC PROVISION AND CONSTRUCTION OF PHRASES IN A TARGET LANGUAGE WERE
DEVISED. ALGORITHMS DESIGNED TO BUILD PREPOSITIONAL OR ADJECTIVAL PHRASES WERE

INFORMATION PROCESSING NETWORKS IN INTERNATIONAL BANKING.
     
DURING THE PAST DECADE THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING CONCERN OVER THE SOCIAL,
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IMPACTS OF INTERNATIONAL COMPUTERISED INFORMATION
NETWORKS. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 3 LEVELS OF SUCH
NETWORKS, EACH WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASINGLY GREATER SOCIAL OR
ORGANISATIONAL IMPACT. BASED ON THAT CATEGORISATION, INTERNATIONAL BANKING WAS
CHOSEN AS THE FOCUS FOR AN ATTITUDE SURVEY CONCERNING THE PERCEIVED EFFECTS
AMONG BANKERS OF USING INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT TELEX IS
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR DAILY INTERNATIONAL BANKING OPERATIONS THAN COMPUTER

ROADBLOCKS IN TYPESETTING FROM THE WORD PROCESSOR.
     
IN THE FUTURE, MANUSCRIPTS MAY FLOW FREELY, AS ELECTRONIC DATA, FROM THE
AUTHOR'S WORD PROCESSOR TO THE PUBLISHER'S AND THENCE TO THE COMPOSITOR'S

THE FUTURE OF SERIALS.
     
THE FUTURE OF SERIALS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPLEX INTER-RELATED
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRINTING AND PUBLISHING INDUSTRY AND BY THE IMPACT OF
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DOMESTIC AND COMMERCIAL INFORMATION MARKETS. SUGGESTS A
RESEARCH PROJECT INTO THE INFORMATION USE OF PROFESSIONALS IN A VARIETY OF
FIELDS, USING DATA GATHERED BY LIBRARIANS OBSERVING PROFESSIONALS AT WORK. THE
RESULTS COULD FORM AN IDEAL BASIS FOR DISCOVERING THE WAYS IN WHICH
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SHOULD EVOLVE IN KEEPING WITH INFORMATION-SEEKING
PATTERNS. SUCH KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE INVALUABLE FOR ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN THE
FUTURE OF SERIALS.

AUTHOR INDEXING.
     
INDEXING TERMS SUPPLIED BY AUTHORS CAN INCREASE SUBJECT CONTROL OF THEIR
DOCUMENTS. THE TERMS CAN BE USED IN THE CREATION OF INDEXES, ABSTRACTS, AND

PICTURE BOOKS: WHAT DO REVIEWS REALLY REVIEW?.
     
TO FIND OUT WHETHER REVIEWS OF PICTURE BOOKS REALLY REVIEW THE PICTURES, 50
REVIEWS PUBLISHED IN 1979 BY EACH OF 4 WIDELY-RESPECTED REVIEWING SOURCES ((1)
2HORNBOOK1, (2) 2BOOKLIST1, (3) 2SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL1, AND (4) 2BULLETIN OF
THE CENTER FOR CHILDREN'S BOOKS1) WERE SELECTED AT RANDOM. A COUNT WAS MADE OF
THE PROPORTION OF WORDS DESCRIBING THE ILLUSTRATIONS AND ALL FACTORS
CONTRIBUTING TO THE 'LOOK' OF A PICTURE BOOK. 70% OF REVIEWS IN (1), 82% IN
(2), 78% IN (3), AND 94% IN (4) DEVOTED 30% OR LESS OF THEIR WORDS TO VISUAL
QUALITIES. THESE RESULTS EXPOSE AN OMISSION IN THE REVIEWERS' RESPONSIBILITIES
AND A DISSERVICE TO READERS.

A STUDY OF THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION SYSTEM IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY UNDERTAKEN BY THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION COMMITTEE OF THE
ROYAL SOCIETY. THE MAJOR CONCLUSION IS THAT A COMBINATION OF PRESSURES WILL
VERY SOON PUT THE UK'S SCHOLARLY SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION SYSTEM UNDER
CONSIDERABLE STRAIN. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE EXTRA FUNDING. 2 MAIN
POSSIBILITIES ARE A SUBSIDY OF PUBLICATIONS AND INCREASED PROVISION FOR
LIBRARIES (ENABLING THEM TO PURCHASE A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PUBLICATIONS AND
THUS ALSO GENERATING INCOME FOR THE PUBLISHERS).

BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY JOURNAL PRICES.
     
A STUDY OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY JOURNAL PRICES FOR 1967-79 IS
PRESENTED. RESULTS SHOW THAT THESE JOURNALS ARE COMPARABLE IN COST TO PHYSICS
AND CHEMISTRY JOURNALS, PREVIOUSLY FOUND MOST COSTLY. WHEN WEIGHTED AVERAGES
ARE COMPARED, THESE JOURNALS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOR WHICH PRICE DATA ARE
AVAILABLE IN THE USA. A SMALL NUMBER OF HIGHLY CITED JOURNALS ACCOUNT FOR
NEARLY 50% OF THE COST OF THE ENTIRE LIST OF 83 JOURNALS STUDIED-A FACT WHICH
HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF JOURNAL COLLECTIONS. THE NEED
FOR GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO ACADEMIC LIBRARIES FOR THE PURCHASE OF SCIENTIFIC
JOURNALS IS REITERATED.

DUAL PRICING OF HEALTH SCIENCES PERIODICALS' A SURVEY.
     
A SURVEY OF DUAL PRICING PRACTICES AMONG PUBLISHERS OF HEALTH-RELATED JOURNALS
IDENTIFIED 281 PERIODICALS WITH AN AVERAGE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL OF OVER 100%
BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION RATES. BOTH THE PRACTICE
ITSELF AND THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL ARE INCREASING, INDICATING THAT
JOURNAL SUBSCRIPTIONS OF HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES INCREASINGLY PROVIDE THE
NECESSARY FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE PUBLICATION OF HEALTH SCIENCES JOURNALS.
DUAL PRICING IS ALSO CORRELATED WITH COPYRIGHT ROYALTIES. PROBLEMS CREATED FOR
HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES' BUDGETS BY DUAL PRICING ARE PARTLY DUE TO
UNCRITICAL PURCHASING BY LIBRARIES. RECOMMENDS INCREASED CONSUMERISM ON THE
PART OF HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARIANS.

THE DANISH PUBLISHING WORLD ABROAD OR THE CHILDREN'S BOOK FAIR IN BOLOGNA 1981.
     
THE 1981 FAIR ILLUSTRATED THE MISERABLE NATURE OF PRESENT-DAY PUBLISHING BUT
WAS A TRUE PICTURE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, 80% OF WHICH CONSISTS OF COMICS,
PICTURE-BOOKS AND COLOURED BOOKS, ALL IN POOR TASTE. CHILDREN'S BOOKS IN
GENERAL ARE AT A LOW LEVEL-THE TV SCREEN IN BOOK FORM-AND THE QUESTION IS
WHETHER COLOURS AND PICTURES SELL WHEREAS CULTURE DOES NOT. SCANDINAVIAN BOOK
PRODUCTION DIFFERS MARKEDLY FROM THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN VARIETY, BREADTH
AND WELL-DEFINED TASTE BUT IS IN AN OBVIOUSLY SCANDINAVIAN STYLE. THE 1981
BOLOGNA FAIR WAS DULL, WITH LITTLE NEW OR OUTSTANDINGLY INTERESTING, AND
BUSINESS ALSO APPEARED TO BE POOR AND MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH JOINT
BOOK-PRODUCTION IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. JOINT PRODUCTION ENABLES DANISH
PUBLISHERS TO ISSUE QUALITY PICTURE BOOKS BUT ALSO HAS INCREASINGLY BECOME THE
MEANS BY WHICH DANISH BOOKS CAN APPEAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

BUT THE BOOKSELLER CAN STILL PREVENT THE TRAGEDY.INT
     
ERVIEWS THE PUBLISHER HENRIK BORBERG ABOUT THE DECLINE IN THE BOOKTRADE AND
HOW TO ARREST IT. BOOKSHOPS SHOULD INSTALL COMPUTER TERMINALS FROM WHICH
CUSTOMERS, FOR PAYMENT, COULD FIND THE INFORMATION WHICH WILL ANSWER THEIR
QUERIES. BOOKSELLERS MUST REALISE THAT THEY ARE INFORMATION PROVIDERS AND
SHOULD BE WILLING TO HANDLE THE INFORMATION SERVICES NOW BEING PUBLISHED BY
MANY SECTIONS OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE AND ALSO OTHER PUBLICATIONS NOW NOT
NORMALLY FOUND IN BOOKSHOPS. DISCUSSES THE EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRONIC BOOK, OR
'POCKET READER'. THIS MEDIUM WILL BE ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR SMALL EDITION
PUBLICATIONS, RESERVING PRINTING FOR LARGE EDITIONS NOW ALREADY BEING SOLD IN
SUPERMARKETS. BOOKSELLERS SHOULD SECURE THIS TRADE, OTHERWISE RADIO DEALERS
AND RECORD SHOPS WILL CAPTURE IT.

LESSING'S LIBRARY POST IN WOLFENBUTTEL. PART I.

GOTTHOLD EPHRAIM LESSING WAS LIBRARIAN AT THE COURT OF BRUNSWICK AND LUNEBERG
IN THE 1770S. SOME OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT WRITINGS WERE PRODUCED DURING THIS
PERIOD BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT THAT THE POST WAS A SINECURE HELD TO
ENABLE HIM TO WRITE. THERE IS PROOF IN HIS OWN WORKS THAT HE TOOK
LIBRARIANSHIP SERIOUSLY. THE OPINIONS OF VARIOUS CONTEMPORARY AND MODERN
WRITERS ON LESSING'S LIBRARY WORK ARE ANALYSED. MANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES
THOUGHT HIM DISORGANISED BUT HIS CATALOGUE OF NEW LIBRARY STOCKS, AMOUNTING TO
ABOUT 100,000 VOLUMES, REMAINED UNFINISHED BECAUSE OF STAFF SHORTAGES AND
ULTIMATELY BECAUSE OF HIS OWN DEATH. SOME PEOPLE REGARD HIM AS THE THEORETICAL
FOUNDER OF MODERN LENDING LIBRARIES.

SOME CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL SITUATION OF LIBRARY SCIENCE.

A POSTGRADUATE PAPER PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL, BRAZIL, EXAMINING THE
VALIDITY OF THE SCIENTIFIC STATUS CLAIMED FOR LIBRARIANSHIP. THE DISTINCTION
BETWEEN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS CLARIFIED, AND RECENT THEORETICAL STUDIES ON
LIBRARY SCIENCE ADDUCED AS EVIDENCE THAT ALTHOUGH IN THEORY LIBRARIANSHIP IS
SCIENTIFIC IN CHARACTER, IN PRACTICE IT IS RATHER A TECHNOLOGY. IN CONCLUSION
THE NON-SCIENTIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF LIBRARIANSHIP ARE ANALYSED AND A

TRANSLATION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONGRESS OF THE IAALD IN MANILA IN 1980,
GIVING A GENERAL VIEW OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE AGRICULTURAL
FIELD IN RELATION TO LIBRARIANSHIP IN GENERAL AND IN OTHER FIELDS. A
PRELIMINARY DEFINITION SETS OUT THE NATURE OF THE WORK OF THE AGRICULTURAL
LIBRARIAN, AND THEN THE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIELD ARE DISCUSSED IN
DETAIL' ITS INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE, THE WIDE RANGE OF TYPES OF
DOCUMENTATION, ITS INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER, AND THE NEED TO DISSEMINATE
INFORMATION TO A DIVERSE COMMUNITY REPRESENTING A WIDE VARIETY OF EDUCATIONAL
BACKGROUNDS. THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF EXISTING SERVICES ARE EXAMINED
WITH REFERENCE TO INFORMATION RESOURCES AND COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES, WHERE THE
EXTENT TO WHICH NETWORK OPPORTUNITIES ARE USED DEPENDS ON THE SCALE AND FOCUS
OF SERVICES OFFERED, AND THIS IN TURN INFLUENCES PROFESSIONAL DUTIES. THE
EDUCATION AND SKILLS ESSENTIAL FOR THE P ROFESSIONAL ARE ANALYSED IN RELATION
TO THE CHANGES IN INFORMATION AND LIBRARY SERVICES IN GENERAL CAUSED BY SOCIAL
AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR ALTERATIONS IN

WORK. WITH REFERENCE TO THE SITUATION AT THE HELSINKI (FINLAND) UNIVERSITY OF
TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES, OFFERS A PERSONAL VIEW ON TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS OF
STAFF IN SUCH LIBRARIES. EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF BASIC TRAINING IN
ENGINEERING, PHYSICS, AND CHEMISTRY; THE NEED FOR KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES; AND
THE NEED FOR EDUCATION IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. SUGGESTS THE OPTION
OF AN EARLIER RETIREMENT AGE FOR LIBRARY STAFF SO THAT NEW STAFF MEMBERS ARE
AS YOUNG, SERVICE-MINDED, AND NON-BUREAUCRATIC AS POSSIBLE.

SCIENCE AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AT THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY, BERLIN.

THE PAMPHLET SERIES DEVELOPED SINCE 1970, ORIGINALLY FOR USE IN CORRESPONDENCE
COURSES ON BASIC AND POST-GRADUATE LIBRARIANSHIP, BUT IS NOW USED ALSO IN
CLASSES AT THE LIBRARY SCHOOL. THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY COMBINES A BASIC
TRAINING FOR BOTH LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS WITH ADDITIONAL SPECIALIST

VITAL NEEDS OF LIBRARIES.

FOR YEARS NOW LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE
EXAMPLE OF THEIR SOVIET COUNTERPARTS IN THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. TARGETS FOR BULGARIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH, TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCEMENT AND THE POPULATION'S HIGHER LIVING STANDARD IN THE 1980S MAKE THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF SOVIET LITERATURE AND PERIODICALS STILL MORE OBVIOUS.
CONCENTRATING UPON CONCRETE TASKS AND PROBLEMS IN THEIR AREA, LIBRARIANS MUST
SUPPLY THEIR READERS AND OTHERS WORKING IN LOCAL INDUSTRIES, RESEARCH
INSTITUTES, SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WITH RELEVANT INFORMATION. SOVIET SOURCES,
SUCH AS TECHNICAL PERIODICALS HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN THE PAST AND WILL
CONTINUE TO BE IN THE FUTURE. LIBRARIANS CAN RELY UPON ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY THE
STAFF AT THE HOUSE OF SOVIET SCIENCE AND CULTURE IN SOFIA. PARTNERSHIPS WITH
SOVIET LIBRARIES HAVE ALSO PROVEN VALUABLE. SOME VENTURES FROM THE PLEVEN
REGION (NORTHERN BULGARIA) ARE GIVEN AS EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL PROMOTION OF
SOVI ET LITERATURE AND EXPERIENCE IN LIBRARIANSHIP AMONG THE BULGARIAN PUBLIC.

THE HOPES PLACED IN THE 'TUPPENNY' LIBRARY IN THE 1930S WERE SEEN TO BE
SHORT-LIVED BY THE 1950S. CIRCULATING LIBRARIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE FROM
WHICH BOOKS WERE BORROWED THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION OR SMALL FEES PAID TO THE
BUSINESS CONCERNS PROVIDING THEM. THEY WERE PRIMARILY FOR RECREATIONAL
READING, AND AGENTS INCLUDED HARROD'S, BOOTS AND SMALLER SHOPS. STOCK WAS
BOUGHT OR OBTAINED THROUGH SUPPLIERS SUCH AS ALLIED LIBRARIES IN MANCHESTER,
WHO DECLINED IN THAT PART OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND CLOSED IT IN 1975, AND SOUTH
COUNTY LIBRARIES WHO SUPPLIED TO 6,000-7,000 AGENTS AFTER THE WAR, AND TO LESS

STATE SUPPORT FOR ECCLESIASTICAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA.

DURING THE LAST 30 YEARS IT HAS BEEN AFFIRMED THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES RUN BY THE CHURCHES IS NEEDED AT STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE
THEY ARE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. CHURCH PUBLIC LIBRARY ACHIEVEMENTS AT THIS TIME
INCLUDE STOCK INCREASES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF STAFF TRAINING AND SOCIAL SERVICE
WITHIN LIBRARIANSHIP. IT IS DISPUTED AS TO WHETHER THEY ARE RELIGIOUS RATHER
THAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND WHETHER CENTRALISED SERVICES FOR THEM ARE TOO
COSTLY. THE SMALLER BRANCHES COULD BE REGARDED AS A HINDRANCE TO THE MOBILE
LIBRARIES AND THE USE OF VOLUNTARY STAFF COULD BE AN EXCUSE NOT TO EMPLOY
FULL-TIME ADMINISTRATORS. A PLURALITY OF LIBRARY AUTHORITIES CAN BE REGARDED
AS ECONOMIC. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS PROVIDED BY THE
STATE, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES WHERE THE CHURCH LIBRARY MAY BE THE ONLY PUBLIC

PROBLEMS AND TASKS OF LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION.

LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR EXISTING PREMISES AS
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS HAS BEEN SEVERELY RESTRICTED, AT LEAST
FOR THE TIME BEING. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE CONDITIONS, LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES MUST BE UNDER CONSTANT REVIEW WITH THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN
MIND. BRANCHES ESTABLISHED IN THE STUDENTS' HALLS OF RESIDENCE HAVE TO PROVIDE
ALL STUDENTS WITH BASIC STUDY LITERATURE. THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ANY
PARTICULAR ESTABLISHMENT HAS TO CATER FOR CENTRALISED AND COORDINATED
ACQUISITIONS AND PROCESSING. USE OF LITERATURE BY STUDENTS AND TEACHING STAFF
MUST ALSO BE FOLLOWED UP AND OBSOLETE ITEMS DISCARDED. GREATER ATTENTION MUST
BE PAID TO POLITICAL AND OTHER LITERATURE DEALING WITH SOCIAL SCIENCES,
ESPECIALLY IN FACULTIES OF APPLIED SCIENCE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT
AESTHETIC EDUCATION BY AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS. THE ROLE OF COMPUTERISED
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, NOW ON A TRIAL BASIS IN SCHOOLS OF ECON OMICS, WILL GROW
IN FUTURE. FOR EXPERT ADVICE LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE TO LOOK ABOVE
ALL TO THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN SOFIA WITH ITS METHODOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT AND
SPECIAL COUNCILS IN MANY SPHERES OF KNOWLEDGE.

AN INDIAN LIBRARIAN LOOKS AT THE PROGRESS OF AMERICAN LIBRARIES IN 1960S AND
1970S.

THE PERIOD IN QUESTION SAW A RAPID GROWTH IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WHICH
REACHED A PEAK AROUND 1974. LOCALISED LIBRARY AUTOMATION WAS ABANDONED IN
FAVOUR OF COOPERATIVE NETWORKS AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS THE RISE OF THE
PHENOMENON OF ON-LINE DATA BASE REFERENCE SERVICES SUCH AS DIALOG.
CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-MEDIA LEARNING
RESOURCES CENTRES. LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION BECAME LESS HIERARCHICAL IN THE
EARLY 1970S WITH MORE TRADE UNION INVOLVEMENT IN EVIDENCE. THE WORSENING
ECONOMIC SITUATION AFTER 1974 LEFT ITS MARK WITH THE DRYING UP OF LIBRARY
VACANCIES AND NOTICEABLE PRESSURE ON LIBRARY RESOURCES.

THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF CHRIST CHURCH LIBRARY, OXFORD.

BOOKS WERE FIRST TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW CHRIST CHURCH LIBRARY BUILDING IN
PECKWATER QUADRANGLE IN THE PERIOD 1763-70. THE POST OF LIBRARY KEEPER WAS
FILLED BY A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE. INITIALLY THE LIBRARY ONLY SERVED
SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE COLLEGE. IN 1869 A LIBRARY COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED TO
OVERSEE THE PURCHASE OF BOOKS AND THE COMPILING AND UPDATING OF CATALOGUES. AN
UNDERGRADUATE READING ROOM WAS SET UP APART FROM THE MAIN BUILDING IN 1884 AND
EXISTED UNTIL 1929. PROBLEMS ARISING FROM INEFFICIENCY AND A LACK OF SPACE
GAVE RISE TO A MAJOR REORGANISATION OF THE LIBRARY'S RESOURCES IN THE 1930S.
AT THE PRESENT TIME NEW ACCESSIONS CURRENTLY RUN TO ABOUT 900 VOLUMES AND 160
PAMPHLETS PER ANNUM. ALL MEMBERS OF THE COLLEGE NOW HAVE ACCESS TO THE LIBRARY
WHICH HAS THE BEST STOCK OF RESEARCH MATERIAL IN OXFORD, APART FROM THE

GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS, A WELL-EQUIPPED UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WAS SEEN AS AN IMPORTANT
PRE-REQUISITE. THE LIBRARY WAS MOVED SEVERAL TIMES, AND IN 1638 A PERMANENT

AND SYSTEMATIC INDICES WERE PRODUCED. STUDENT WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BORROW BOOKS
FOR HOME READING, ALTHOUGH PROFESSORS COULD DO SO, AND PROFESSORS OFTEN STOOD
BAIL FOR THOSE WHO DEFAULTED ON THE RESTRICTIONS. LIBRARIANS WERE CHOSEN FROM

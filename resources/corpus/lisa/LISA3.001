INTERVIEWS INGAR BECKMAN-HIRSCHFELDT, CHAIRMAN OF THE SWEDISH PUBLIC
LIBRARIANS' UNION (SFF) IN CONNECTION WITH A CAMPAIGN ORGANISED BY DIK
(DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION, CULTURE), AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION OF 8
ASSOCIATIONS, OF WHICH SFF IS A MEMBER. THE CAMPAIGN AIMS TO PUT PRESSURE ON
POLITICIANS UP TO THE TIME OF LOCAL AND GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1982 AND
DEMONSTRATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CUTS; A DISCUSSION BOOK DESCRIBING THE PRESENT
STATE OF CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND STATING ALTERNATIVES WHICH WOULD GIVE

ENSURE REASONABLE AND UNIFORM STANDARDS WILL BE MADE. CUTS IN CULTURAL
SERVICES ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO DIK AND LIBRARIANS ARE URGED NOT TO COOPERATE IN
SUGGESTING CUTS IN SERVICES AND MANPOWER. SFF EXPECTS LITTLE FROM THE PUBLIC

CONTENDS THAT THE PRESENT FAR-REACHING SCOPE AND VARIETY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND

ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
IN THE 1980S, BULGARIAN LIBRARIES MUST MEET THE COMMUNIST PARTY REQUIREMENTS
TO BECOME IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS NOT ONLY TO THE COUNTRY'S TECHNOLOGICAL
PROGRESS BUT ALSO TO THE POPULATION'S AESTHETIC EDUCATION. TO BECOME EQUAL
PARTNERS IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES HAVE TO
REASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR, AND THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING LIBRARY COOPERATION
AND COORDINATION IN RESPECT OF BUILDING UP THEIR BOOK COLLECTIONS. ACQUISITION
OF PUBLICATIONS AND PERIODICALS FROM THE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES MUST, IN
PARTICULAR, BE PLANNED VERY CAREFULLY CONSIDERING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY
RESOURCES. ON THE OTHER HAND, LIBRARIES MUST CONSIDER AS THE 1ST AND FOREMOST
DUTY THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE USSR
AND OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES FROM WHICH PUBLICATIONS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE.
INTERLIBRARY LENDING MUST BE BACKED UP AND EXPEDITED BY EFFICIENT TELEX AND
PHOTOCOPYING SERVICES. WELL-KEPT B IBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES NOT ONLY HAVE
INFORMATION VALUE BUT THEY ALSO HELP IN ATTRACTING NEW READERS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THOUGH SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS
BELIEVE CENSORSHIP IS A RECENT PHENOMENON, IT HAS BEEN A PART OF LIBRARIANS'
LIVES FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. INDEED, MANY LATE-19TH CENTURY LIBRARIANS
REGARDED THEMSELVES PRIMARILY AS CENSORS, DUTY-BOUND TO PROTECT THE YOUNG FROM
SHODDY AND PERNICIOUS BOOKS, ESPECIALLY FICTION. SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS
TODAY CARRY ON THIS CENSORIAL TRADITION BY CIRCULATING OR TEACHING ONLY WORKS
OF HIGH LITERARY MERIT OR THE PROPER MORAL CONTENT. THOSE CENSORING ON
LITERARY GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE ONLY SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP
BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL TASTES. THOSE CENSORING ON MORAL GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE
NO BETTER CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL MORALITY. LIBR
ARIANS AND TEACHERS HAVE NO RIGHT TO IMPOSE PERSONAL LITERARY OR MORAL
STANDARDS ON THE PUBLIC, YOUNG OR OLD. THEY HAVE A DUTY TO PROVIDE MATERIALS
OF ALL SORTS TO ALLOW CLIENTS AND STUDENTS TO SEARCH THROUGH AND SEEK OUT

IN BERLIN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL IS NOW COMPLETELY INTEGRATED INTO THE UNIVERSITY

LIBRARY EDUCATION FROM 3 PERSPECTIVES' COGNITIVE, CYBERNETIC, AND
DEVELOPMENTAL.
     
LIBRARY EDUCATION HAS BEEN PART OF THE US HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM SINCE 1870.
IT REMAINED POPULAR UNTIL WORLD WAR II AND THEN THERE WAS A SUDDEN DROP IN
POPULARITY. IT WAS REVIVED ONLY IN THE LATE 1950S AND EARLY 60S. ANALYSES THE
LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMME IN TERMS OF LEARNING, TEACHING, CURRICULUM AND
EVALUATION FROM COGNITIVE, CYBERNETIC AND DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVES.
DISCUSSES A 3 PART PROGRAMME WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED SUCESSFULLY
AT COLGATE UNIVERSITY. PROGRAMMES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY AND UNIVERSITY OF DENVER ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. THE EXPERIENCE
OF LIBRARIANS IS THAT IT IS EASY FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN THE BROADER CONCEPTS OF
THE USAGE OF THE LIBRARY AND DO RESEARCH, RATHER THAN REMEMBER MANY TITLES FOR
EACH SUBJECT OF THEIR RESEARCH.

SOME PROBLEMS WITH PART-TIME COURSES IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
IN ADDITION TO FULLTIME COURSES OFFERED BY THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN
SOFIA, PART-TIME COURSES, I.E. IN-SERVICE COURSES, HELP TO INCREASE THE NUMBER
OF QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS. FROM 1960 TO 1976, 936 PART-TIME STUDENTS ENROLLED,
AND 834, I.E. 89%, COMPLETED THEIR STUDIES INCLUDING 16 STUDENTS FROM THE
CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY. 99% OF THE STUDENTS WERE WOMEN, WHO WERE
FORCED FREQUENTLY TO EXTEND THEIR STUDIES BEYOND 3 YEARS BECAUSE OF MATERNITY
LEAVE, ILLNESS AND OTHER REASONS. IN FUTURE, THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES, IN
PARTICULAR, MUST HELP TO SELECT SUITABLE CANDIDATES AS PROSPECTIVE PART-TIME
STUDENTS. LIBRARIES ALSO HAVE A DUTY TO INTENSIFY THEIR ASSISTANCE TO ENROLLED
PART-TIME STUDENTS, PROVIDE HELP DURING THE COURSE AS WELL AS TO ASSIST THOSE
STUDENTS WHO ARE PREPARING FOR FINAL EXAMINATIONS AND THESES. ONLY THEN CAN
PART-TIME COURSES GRADUALLY BECOME AN EQUIVALENT TO FULLTIME STUDY.

OF ITS SUBSTANTIVE NUCLEUS, INFORMATION. ACCORDINGLY, TEACHING PROGRAMMES ARE
REQUIRED TO COVER BOTH ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION, WITH
THE CURRICULUM ITSELF SERVING AS A MODEL OF EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION. THE

INSTEAD LIBRARIES, GIVING IN TO POPULAR DEMAND, CONTAIN A SURFEIT OF MEDIOCRE
AUTHORS. LOCAL FREEDOM TO SELECT IS LARGELY AN ILLUSION AS IN PRACTICE THE
BINDING CENTRE'S REVIEWS ARE HEAVILY RELIED UPON. THE POPULARITY OF
SOCIOLOGICAL AND WOMEN'S NOVELS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED ENTIRELY, HOWEVER, AS
LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CATER BOTH FOR QUALITY AND TOPICALITY. AUTHORS
OF SCHOOL AND CHILDREN'S BOOKS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND OF ADULT BOOKS, ON THE
OTHER, SHOULD HAVE THEIR LIBRARY FEES ASSESSED SEPARATELY. THE WORK OF
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS IS EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL AND THEIR TRAINING SHOULD
REFLECT THIS; LITERARY QUALITY HARDLY APPLIES TO CHILDREN'S LITERATURE.

UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' STANDARDS AND STATISTICS.
     
THE ARL-ACRL STANDARDS FOR UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES DO NOT PRESENT QUANTITATIVE
STANDARDS, BUT RATHER PLACE THEIR EMPHASIS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES. THROUGH THE STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES OF CORRELATION AND REGRESSION,
DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS, AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS IT IS POSSIBLE TO
ANALYSE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DATA AND TO DERIVE MINIMAL CRITERIA THAT
STATISTICALLY DISTINGUISH UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES FROM OTHER KINDS OF ACADEMIC

WORKPLACE LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY' MUTUAL COMPETITION FOR THE BEST LOAN
STATISTICS.
     
AFTER THE 2ND WORLD WAR, WEST GERMANY CONTINUED AS IT LEFT OFF IN 1933, WITH
FACTORY LIBRARIES IN THE OLD PATRIARCHAL FORM AND LIBRARY POLICIES WITH
TRADITIONAL BOURGEOIS IDEALS. IN EAST GERMANY, HOWEVER, A PERIOD OF
DENAZIFICATION AND REBUILDING OF SOCIETY IN A SOCIALIST FORM FOLLOWED THE WAR.
LIBRARIES RECEIVED HIGH PRIORITY IN THE ANTI-FASCIST PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN, WITH
ACCESS TO LIBRARIES IN 96% OF DISTRICTS IN 1957 COMPARED TO 40% IN 1947. A
PURGE OF LIBRARY BOOKS WAS CARRIED OUT ON STALINIST PRINCIPLES WITH SOME
LIBRARIES LOSING UP TO 90% OF THEIR STOCK. HOWEVER, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM
EXPANDED RAPIDLY, BUT WITHOUT DEVIATION FROM THE IDEOLOGICAL LINE IN BOOK
SELECTION. A NETWORK OF WORKPLACE LIBRARIES UNDER THE TRADE UNIONS HAS ALSO
BEEN DEVELOPED IN KEEPING WITH THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHED TO LIBRARIES FOR
IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION. THE BASIS FOR THESE LIBRARIES IS THE MAXIM' ALL WORKERS
MUST READ. TH E LIBRARIES MUST REACH A CERTAIN NORM IN LENDING FIGURES AND
CONTROL WITH THE MATERIAL BORROWED IS POSSIBLE. THE WORKPLACE LIBRARIES, FAR
FROM BEING AN EXPRESSION OF WORKING CLASS DEMOCRACY, ARE AN IDEOLOGICAL
INSTRUMENT OF THE TRADE UNION LEADERSHIP DIRECTED AT THE WORKING CLASS.

DESCRIBES THE WORK OF ARHUS PUBLIC LIBRARIES' AV DEPARTMENT, OPENED IN DEC 80.
THE EQUIPMENT INCLUDES RECORD PLAYERS, TAPE RECORDERS, SCREENS FOR SLIDES AND
TRANSCRIPT READERS FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TEXT. THE STOCK INCLUDES BOOKS WITH
TAPES, TALKING BOOKS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN, ART SLIDES, NON-MUSICAL RECORDS
AND CASSETTES, EASY READERS, PICTORIAL WORKS AND MAGNAPRINT BOOKS. THE USERS
ARE THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED, MOSTLY THE ELDERLY, AND THOSE WITH

LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE HANDICAPPED PLACES GREATER DEMANDS ON THE STAFF THAN
OTHER LENDING SERVICES. FEW USERS ARE ABLE TO HELP THEMSELVES TO MATERIAL AND
NEED ASSISTANCE FROM THE STAFF; MOST MATERIAL NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED AND PLAYED
BEFORE BORROWING AND CHECKING ON RETURN. THE DEPARTMENT BUYS PUBLISHED

SERIAL COST EFFICIENCY-A MODEL AND CASE STUDY (IN HEBREW).
     
HIGH RATE INFLATION IN PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION PRICES WITHOUT ADEQUATE BUDGET
INCREMENTS FORCE MANY LIBRARIES TO FREEZE NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS AND IN MANY CASES
TO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS. THE PROCESS OF DESELECTION RAISES THE QUESTION OF
WHICH TITLES WILL BE RETAINED AND WHICH WILL BE DISCONTINUED. SUGGESTS THAT
THE EVALUATION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS TITLES WILL BE DONE
BY USING A COST EFFICIENCY FORMULA. THE FORMULA COMBINES 2 FACTORS, THE PRICE
OF SUBSCRIPTION AND THE MEASURED USE OF THE JOURNAL, AND RANKS PERIODICALS IN
A GIVEN COLLECTION IN A DESCENDING ORDER' AT THE TOP WILL BE THE MOST
COST-EFFICIENT TITLE AND AT THE BOTTOM THE LEAST COST-EFFICIENT TITLE. THIS

SOME THOUGHTS ON THE FINANCING OF LIBRARIES.
     
ARGUES THAT SAVING MONEY FOR THE UNIVERSITY BY CUTTING ITS LIBRARY BUDGET IS
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THE ARGUMENT IS APPLIED TO SUCH AREAS AS STAFF CUTS AND
PROCESSING BACKLOGS, SERIOUS REDUCTIONS IN SERVICE LEADING TO UNDERMINING OF
THE LIBRARY'S SUPPORTIVE ROLE FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S TEACHING AND RESEARCH
FUNCTION. ARGUES THAT RATIONALISATION OF SUBJECT INTERESTS AND SUBJECTS TAUGHT
BY THE UNIVERSITIES IN AN AREA SHOULD LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES.

THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE LIMPING SADLY BEHIND-SHOWS NEW REPORT ON THE
CONDITIONS OF RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.
     
ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED IN APRIL 81 BY THE RESEARCH SECRETARIAT, DENMARK
LAGS BEHIND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN ITS SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH, BOTH PUBLIC
AND PRIVATE. THE REPORT DEALS SEPARATELY WITH RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND DESCRIBES
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CUTS BOTH FOR LIBRARIES AND THEIR MOTHER INSTITUTIONS;
IT SHOWS THAT THE LIBRARIES USE LESS THAN 10% OF THE EXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH.
INCLUDES COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE JOINT
COUNCIL OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE
RESEARCH LIBRARIES' ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SHOULD BE SOLVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH,
AND PREFERABLY BEFORE, ANY CHANGE IN THEIR STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT. IT POINTS
OUT THAT FIGURES FOR RUNNING COSTS OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES UNDER THE CULTURAL
MINISTRY, AFTER ADJUSTMENT, SHOW A GREATER FALL THAN OF THOSE UNDER THE
EDUCATION MINISTRY.

LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE ON READING MATERIALS FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION,
WEST BERLIN, 15-20 DEC 80. IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE AVERAGE CITIZEN
IS POOR AND ILLITERATE AND 90% OF THE POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS, WHERE
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION SERVICES ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN MOST
UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE FINANCIAL BUDGET ALLOCATED TO LIBRARY STAFF AND
BOOKSTOCK IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN ADDITION, IN SOME COUNTRIES CONSIDERABLE
SUMS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF CITY LIBRARIES TO U.K. AND U.S.A.
STANDARDS WITH A CONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN FUNDS FOR RURAL AREAS. THE AVAILABLE
RESOURCES SHOULD BE DIVIDED MORE EVENLY TO PROVIDE IMPROVED SERVICES
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

RESPONSE TO THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK AID PROGRAMME TO STIMULATE
LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. THE NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE WAS MUCH MORE POSITIVE AND MANY

PERIODICALS AND OTHER MEDIA, AND DO NOT REFER TO SPECIAL SERVICES SUCH AS
PHOTOCOPYING. THE ASSOCIATION IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO CHARGES BEING MADE FOR
BASIC SERVICES WHICH IT REGARDS AS A RETROGRADE STEP THAT COULD ONLY HARM THE

THE LIBRARY SITUATION IN ENGLAND' INCREASING DEMAND FOR SELF-FINANCING OF
SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS.
     
EXAMINES THE STATE OF LIBRARIES IN THE UK. DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ESPECIALLY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CUTS RESULTING IN FEWER
ACQUISITIONS, CLOSURE OF BRANCHES, REDUCED OPENING HOURS AND FREEZING OF STAFF
POSTS. AT THE SAME TIME ATTEMPTS ARE MADE TO INCREASE INCOME THROUGH INCREASED
FINES AND SALE OF DISCARDED MATERIAL AND PAMPHLETS, ALTHOUGH LENDING FEES HAVE
NOT YET BEEN IMPOSED. INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES IS SEEN BY MANY
AS A MEANS OF REDUCING STAFF EXPENDITURE AND IMPROVING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC,
ESPECIALLY COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. THE LIBRARY PROVISION FOR CHILDREN, NEVER
VERY GOOD COMPARED TO DANISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES, HAS BEEN STRUCK PARTICULARLY
HARD BY THE CUTS. THE REACTION AGAINST THE CUTS HAS BEEN LED BY NALGO IN THE
FORM OF WORK STOPPAGES AND BY THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AS PROTESTS TO THE

INTERVIEWS JAN GUMPERT, DIRECTOR OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SERVICE, WHO DISCUSSES
THE IMPACT OF CUTS ON THE LIBRARIES. LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE FINDING THEIR
CULTURAL BUDGETS, WITH LIBRARIES AS THE LARGEST ITEM, EASY TARGETS. ATTEMPTS
ARE MADE TO SAVE THE BOOK BUDGET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND CUTS ARE MADE INSTEAD
IN OPENING HOURS AND ACTIVITIES. VACANCIES ARE LIKELY TO BE FROZEN. FOR THE
LIBRARY SERVICE THE CUTS MEAN THAT THE STOCK OF OLDER TITLES WILL HAVE TO BE
REDUCED, BUT THERE ARE NO PLANS TO CUT THE NUMBER OF TITLES OFFERED. EXPORT OF
LIBRARY FURNITURE TO THE ARAB WORLD ALLEVIATES SOMEWHAT THE LACK OF MARKETS IN
SWEDEN. THE SERVICE'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, BUMS, IS NOW INSTALLED IN 34 LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. THERE IS CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES'

SINCE THE WORLD WAR II THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS
UNDERGONE A PERIOD OF RAPID GROWTH. IN MANY TOWNS, NEW CENTRAL LIBRARIES AND
BRANCH LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN OPENED AND SPECIAL SERVICES HAVE BEEN INITIATED,
SUCH AS MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES, RECORD LIBRARIES AND SERVICES TO FOREIGN
WORKERS AND OPEN SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN ADDITION, THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT PLANS TO
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIES FROM 13 TO 19. HOWEVER,
ENSCHEDE PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED A REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARY,
IS COMPELLED BY FINANCIAL CUTBACKS TO REDUCE ITS PRESENT STAFFING LEVELS BY
25%. AS A RESULT THE LIBRARY WILL BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT VOLUME OF
LOANS AND CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BOOKS WHICH A
BORROWER MAY TAKE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND TO REFUSING TO ENROL NEW MEMBERS.

INDISPENSIBLE CONSIDERATIONS IN AUTOMATING LIBRARY TECHNIQUES.
     
LIBRARIES, DESPITE THEIR TRADITION-MINDED REPUTATION, ALWAYS WERE SENSIBLE
ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THEIR DUTIES AND OPEN TO INNOVATIONS.
CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES HERE IS DISCUSSED. THESE
SYSTEMS USUALLY ARE NOT DEVELOPED ON UNIQUE PRINCIPLES FOR LIBRARY PURPOSES,
BUT HAVE BEEN ADAPTED FROM PRINCIPLES ALREADY EXISTING IN OTHER APPLICATIONS.
SOME OF THESE PRINCIPLES ARE MORE APT FOR APPLICATION IN LIBRARIES THAN OTHERS
REGARDING THE SPECIAL DUTIES OF LIBRARIES TOWARDS THEIR USERS. THIS FACT TODAY
SEEMS TO BE SLIGHTLY UNDERRATED WHEN LIBRARIES DECIDE ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OF
AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM.

INSTALLED AN ON-LINE ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM BY CLSI. WITH AUTHOR AND TITLE DATA
ALREADY IN THE DATA BASE, THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ON-LINE PUBLIC ACCESS
CATALOGUE WITH A TOUCH SENSITIVE TERMINAL, OPENED IN OCT 80, WAS FACILITATED.
THE CARD CATALOGUE IS, HOWEVER, BEING MAINTAINED, AS THE INPUT OF SUBJECT DATA

THE LIBRARIAN'S 'CLIENTS' IN THE FURTHER EDUCATION SECTOR ARE IDENTIFIED. HIS
DUTIES TOWARDS THEM AND THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THEM ARE DISCUSSED, WITH
SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE EDUCATION OF THE 16-19 AGE GROUP. THE NEED FOR THE
LIBRARIAN TO HOLD THEIR DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING DEMANDS IN BALANCE
IS SEEN AS AN ASPECT OF HIS DUTIES THAT REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY FOR ITS
SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE. THE NEED FOR A BALANCED USE OF THE FACILITIES,
COVERAGE OF SUBJECT AREAS, PROVISION FOR DIVERGENT VIEWS, AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF
FREE ENQUIRY LEADS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT TREATMENT RATHER THAN IDEAS IS WHAT
THE LIBRARIAN IS BEST QUALIFIED TO ASSESS. PORNOGRAPHY IS DISCUSSED IN
RELATION TO THIS AND OTHER CRITERIA. THE GROWTH OF OPEN LEARNING IS SEEN AS
DEMANDING A POSITIVE TUTORIAL APPROACH. THE NEED FOR MORAL COURAGE IS

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE CHILDREN
ACCESS TO INFORMATION, WE MUST' ESTABLISH THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCE-SHARING
ARRANGEMENTS; GRANT CHILDREN THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THEM; AND INCLUDE
CHILDREN'S MATERIALS AND RESOURCES IN THE DEVELOPING DATA SYSTEMS. CURRENT
STUDIES REVEAL THAT, ALTHOUGH AS CHILDREN REACH JUNIOR HIGH AGE THEY USE THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY PREDOMINANTLY FOR SCHOOL PROJECTS, NEITHER SCHOOL NOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ARE IMPORTANT IN THE CHILD'S TOTAL PATTERN OF INFORMATION SEEKING.
LACK OF TRANSPORTATION, TIME, AND SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS BASED ON LIBRARY
RESOURCES CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PATTERN. WHILE MULTIPLE COOPERATIVES SUCH AS
THOSE DEVELOPING IN COLORADO AND BEING INITIATED IN NEW YORK ARE OF INTEREST
AND SHOW PROMISE, LARGE-SCALE FAILURE TO DEVELOP INTER- AND INTRALIBRARY LOAN
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHICH INCLUDE CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS AS USERS
FURTHER INHIBIT ACCESS BY THE YOUNG. AS OF THIS TIME, LITTLE OF THE MASSIVE
AMOUNT OF CURRICULAR, HISTORICAL, TEXTUAL, OR LITERARY MATERIALS FOR CHILDREN
ARE BEING INCLUDED IN DEVELOPING AUTOMATED DATA BASES AND SYSTEMS, THUS
DENYING THEIR ACCESS TO ADULTS AS WELL AS TO YOUTH. IN FIGHTING THE BATTLE OF

BUILDING IN 1970. THIS WAS AN ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM AND WAS FOLLOWED BY
AUTOMATION OF MOST TECHNICAL ROUTINES. UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS THE LIBRARY USER
INFORMATION SERVICE, (LUIS), A SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS ON-LINE SEARCHING IN THE
LIBRARY'S CATALOGUE OF ACQUISITIONS SINCE 1970. THE CARD CATALOGUE IS,
HOWEVER, BEING MAINTAINED MEANTIME AS LUIS DOES NOT ALLOW SUBJECT SEARCHES,
NOR HAS FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DETAILS. ALTHOUGH COST EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTOMATION
PRIOR TO ITS INTRODUCTION HAD NOT BEEN CONSIDERED THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SMOOTHLY
INSTALLED AND HAD LED TO INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY IN THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT.
THERE WAS GENERAL SATISFACTION WITH THE FACT THAT THE LIBRARY HAD BEEN AB LE

STATUS REPORT ON THE MAP CATALOGING PROJECT AT THE ILLINOIS STATE LIBRARY.
     
ILLINOIS STATE LIBRARY BEGAN ITS MAP CATALOGUING PROJECT ON 1 AUG 80. ALL
FORMERLY UNCATALOGUED SHEET MAPS ARE BEING CATALOGUED IN MARC MAP FORMAT AND
THOSE ALREADY CATALOGUED BY VARIOUS METHODS ARE BEING RECATALOGUED, USING
OCLC. BECAUSE THE STATE LIBRARY IS A REGIONAL GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE
DEPOSITORY, THE FEDERAL MAPS ARE BEING CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE SUDOC
(SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS) SYSTEM. ALL OTHER MAPS ARE BEING CLASSIFIED BY
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS G SYSTEM. DESCRIBES PROGRESS ON THE PROJECT AND

AACR2' OCLC'S IMPLEMENTATION AND DATABASE CONVERSION.
     
OCLC'S ONLINE UNION CATALOG (OLUC) CONTAINS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS CREATED
UNDER VARIOUS CATALOGUING GUIDELINES. UNTIL DEC 80, NO SYSTEM-WIDE ATTEMPT HAD
BEEN MADE TO RESOLVE RECORD CONFLICTS CAUSED BY USE OF THE DIFFERENT
GUIDELINES. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW GUIDELINES, AACR2, EXACERBATED THESE
RECORD CONFLICTS. TO REDUCE LIBRARY COSTS, WHICH MIGHT INCREASE DRAMATICALLY
AS USERS ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THOSE CONFLICTS, OCLC CONVERTED NAME HEADINGS
AND UNIFORM TITLES IN ITS DATA BASE TO AACR2 FORM.

OCLC-AN AMERICAN INFORMATION SYSTEM ON ITS WAY TO DENMARK.
     
LIBRARY AUTOMATION BEGAN IN 1965 WITH THE FIRST MARC PILOT PROJECT INITIATED
BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND SOON TAKEN UP BY THE BRITISH NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP TO SECURE WORLDWIDE
USE OF THE SYSTEM, CULMINATING IN THE ATTEMPT TO CREATE UNIVERSAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL. HOWEVER, EXCHANGE OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA
HAS BEEN BESET BY PROBLEMS, SO THAT INTERNATIONAL USE OF MACHINE READABLE
INFORMATION IS NOT VERY WIDESPREAD. THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL, ENGLISH LANGUAGE
BASED STANDARDS AND EXCHANGE OF ACTUAL TAPE HAVE CAUSED PROBLEMS IN
SCANDINAVIA. FOR THESE REASONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICE CENTRES, 'UTILITIES',
HAVE BEEN SET UP IN USA AND ENGLAND, AN IDEA WHICH IS ALSO BEHIND THE DANISH
SYSTEMS SAMKAT AND BIBLIOTEKSDATA. THE LARGEST IS THE US OCLC, WHICH BEGAN IN
1967. ITS MAIN TASK IS DEVELOPMENT OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE AND
DECENTRALISED CATALOGUING, WHICH SUPPLIES THE BASE WITH 60, 000 TITLES
ANNUALLY FROM 4,000 TERMINALS. IT ALSO OPERATES AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM, AND
HOPES TO ADD ACCESSIONS AND ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS TO THE SERVICES. THE MAIN
PRODUCT IS CATALOGUE CARDS. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 'OCLC EUROPE', DANISH
LIBRARIES WILL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND FOR OR AGAINST COOPERATION WITH IT.

CATALOGUES ON FILM.
     
DESCRIBES CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY'S AUTOMATION SYSTEM. IN 1974 THE LIBRARY
JOINED THE OCLC NETWORK AND TODAY ALL TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS ARE AUTOMATED. THE
USERS MEET AUTOMATION THROUGH THE COM CATALOGUE (COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFILM), A
SYSTEM REGARDED AS MUCH CHEAPER THAN AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. THERE WERE MANY
TEETHING TROUBLES INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL USE OF THE CATALOGUE, PARTICULARLY
IN THE BRANCH LIBRARIES, AND THE AUTOMATED ACQUISITION SYSTEM LED TO A VERY
TIGHT BUDGET CONTROL OVER THE BRANCHES. ALTHOUGH NEW EDITIONS OF THE COM
CATALOGUE TAKE LONGER TO ARRIVE THAN PROMISED IT HAS LED TO IMPROVED
INTERLENDING SERVICE. THE PUBLIC, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO USE THE OLD
DISCONTINUED CARD CATALOGUE AS, IT WAS CLAIMED, THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE
LIBRARY SERVICE'S TOTAL HOLDINGS, BUT ONLY IN THE STOCK OF THE LIBRARY BRANCH
USED. THE STAFF, TOO, DESPITE LACK OF ORGANISED OPPOSITION, EXPRESSED

MEASURES ARE NECESSARY' THE ACCELERATION OF CATALOGUING OF ALL PERIODICAL
COLLECTIONS IN ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES INVOLVED IN THE NATIONAL LITERATURE
SUPPLY SYSTEM; THE DATA COLLECTIONS OF OTHER PERIODICAL REFERENCE SYSTEMS
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DATA BANK; TITLE DATA IN THE PERIODICAL DATA BANK
SHOULD BE COMPARED WITH THAT SUPPLIED BY SUBJECT INFORMATION SERVICES WITH A
VIEW TO ACQUIRING MISSING TITLES; THE DATA BANK SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED IN AN

ON THE INCLUSIVENESS OF SYSTEMS FOR RETRIEVAL DOCUMENTS INDEXED BY UNWEIGHTED
DESCRIPTORS.
     
ONE MEANS OF REDUCING INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TIME IS BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
PROPERTY OF INCLUSIVENESS OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WHEN ONE KNOWS THE
SYSTEM RESPONSE TO A QUERY WHICH IS MORE GENERAL IN RELATION TO ANOTHER QUERY,
THEN IN AN INCLUSIVE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO RETRIEVE THE RESPONSE TO THE
MORE SPECIFIC QUERY IT SUFFICES TO LIMIT THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROCESS TO
THE SEARCH OF THE SYSTEM RESPONSE TO THE MORE GENERAL QUERY. DEMONSTRATES THE
PROPERTY OF INCLUSIVENESS OF DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WHERE DOCUMENTS ARE
INDEXED BY UNWEIGHTED DESCRIPTORS, AND IN WHICH QUERY SEARCH PATTERNS ARE
BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS OF DESCRIPTORS (SYSTEMS USING THE INVERTED FILE METHOD, THE
CANONICAL STRUCTURE FILE-METHOD, OR THE SEQUENTIAL FILE METHOD). THE PAPER
PRESENTS 3 METHODS FOR A DETERMINING A PARTIAL ORDERING RELATION ON A SET OF
BOOLEAN SEARCH PATTERNS OF QUERIES, IMPLYING A PARTIAL ORDERI NG ON THE SET OF

RELATIVE IMPACT OF PRINT AND DATABASE PRODUCTS ON DATABASE PRODUCER EXPENSES

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS.
     
A 13-YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCES OF A MAJOR DATA BASE PRODUCER ORGANISATION,
WHICH IS ALSO A PUBLISHER OF ABSTRACTING AND INDEXING PRODUCTS, INDICATES
TRENDS REGARDING THE IMPACT THAT BOTH PRINTED PRODUCTS AND DATA BASE PRODUCTS
HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE ORGANISATION. THE QUESTION OF 'MIGRATION'
(FROM PRINTED TO ON-LINE DATA BASE PRODUCTS) AND THE FACT THAT EXPENSES HAVE
INCREASED MORE THAN INCOME ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO THE SURVIVAL OR
GROWTH OF DATA BASE ORGANISATIONS. SINCE THE DATA BASE HAS GONE ON-LINE, THERE
HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE DATA BASE REVENUE, CONNECT HOURS, AND
NUMBERS OF ON-LINE USERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN DECREASES IN THE
NUMBER OF DATA BASE LEASES AND LICENCES, THE NUMBER OF PRINT PRODUCT
SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND THE EXCESS OF INCOME OVER EXPENSES. IN CONSTA NT DOLLARS,
THE COST OF PRODUCING AN ABSTRACT HAS DECREASED, THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGE FOR
PRINTED PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY, THE LEASE AND LICENSE FEES HAVE
DECREASED, ROYALTY CHARGES HAVE INCREASED, AND HOURLY CONNECT FEES HAVE
REMAINED STEADY (EVEN THOUGH THE SIZE OF THE ON-LINE FILE HAS INCREASED
GREATLY). THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MAINTAINING A BALANCED FINANCIAL STATUS IN
LIGHT OF INCREASED INCOME FROM ONE CLASS OF PRODUCTS, DECREASED INCOME FROM
ANOTHER CLASS OF PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED COST OF OPERATION. POSSIBLE
APPROACHES TO ENSURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY ARE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF EXPENSES,
EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION, MARKETING, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICING. THE MOST
PROMISING APPROACHES LIE IN THE AREAS OF PRICING AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW
PRODUCTS AND SERVI CES. THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A CONSORTIUM OF DATA
BASE PRODUCERS FOR OFFERING ON-LINE SERVICES IS PROPOSED. THERE APPEARS TO BE

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA BASES IN THE
HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, MADRID 16-19 JUNE 80. DESCRIBES THE USE OF A
COMPUTERISED TEXT PROCESSING SYSTEM TO PRODUCE PRINTED AND ON-LINE VERSIONS OF
THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES IN HISTORY-2HISTORICAL ABSTRACTS1 AND 2AMERICA'
HISTORY AND LIFE1. ABSTRACTS OR CITATIONS OF BOOKS, ARTICLES AND DISSERTATIONS
ARE EDITED, SUBJECT-CLASSIFIED, AND SUBJECT AND AUTHOR-INDEXED. THE AMERICAN
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTER'S PROFILE INDEX IS A COMPUTER-ASSISTED, ROTATED STRING
INDEX, THE VOCABULARY IS A COMBINATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE KEY WORDS AND
PREFERRED SUBJECT HEADINGS SELECTED BY EDITOR-INDEXERS. THE PROCESSING SYSTEM
COMPRISES KEYBOARDING, EXTRACTION OF INDEX TERMS, EXPANSION OF ABBREVIATED
INDEX TERMS TO FULL TEXT, FILE CORRECTION, SORTING AND PHOTOCOMPOSITION OF
PAGES. FILES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES ARE SORTED FOR USE IN 1 OR MORE DATA
BASES, AND ANNUAL INDEX FILES ARE MERGED TO PRODUCT CUMULATIVE INDEXES.

A COMPARISON OF TWO WEIGHTING SCHEMES FOR BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.
     
DESCRIBES 2 APPROACHES, TIED TOGETHER BY THEIR CONCEPTUAL BASIS IN FUZZY SET
THEORY, FOR REPRESENTING WEIGHTED BOOLEAN REQUESTS. ONE REPRESENTS DIRECTLY
THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPONENT BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS TO THE USER. THE OTHER
ESTABLISHES CONDITIONS THAT MUST BE MET BEFORE A DOCUMENT CAN BE RETRIEVED.
BOTH MAY HAVE A PLACE IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS-THEIR RELATIVE
STRENGTHS SHOULD APPEAR THROUGH EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION.

MESSAGE EXTRACTION THROUGH ESTIMATION OF RELEVANCE.
     
ASSOCIATIVE RETRIEVAL STRATEGIES ARE ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE WHEN A DATA BASE
CONTAINS INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF FULL TEXT AND THE COLLECTION OF TEXTS IS
LARGE AND CHANGING SO FAST THAT NO USER CAN BE FAMILIAR WITH ITS CONTENTS. THE
METER (MESSAGE EXTRACTION THROUGH ESTIMATION OF RELEVANCE) SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED
TO APPLY SUCH STRATEGIES EFFECTIVELY AND INEXPENSIVELY FOR A CHANGING DATA
BASE OF UP TO 20,000 MESSAGES (TEXTS OR DOCUMENTS) OF ABOUT 2,000 CHARACTERS
EACH, WITH NEW MESSAGES ARRIVING AT THE RATE OF 4,000-5,000 DAILY. IT RUNS ON
A DEC PDP-11/45 MINICOMPUTER WITHOUT SPECIAL HARDWARE, WITH A RESPONSE TIME OF
ABOUT A MINUTE FOR 5 SIMULTANEOUS USERS, AND WITH NEARLY 24 HOURS/DAY ACCESS.
DESCRIBES THE SYSTEM, ITS BASIC THEORY, AND ITS EVALUATION.

ESTABLISHING A BASIS FOR MAPPING NATURAL-LANGUAGE STATEMENTS ONTO A DATABASE
QUERY LANGUAGE.
     
DESCRIBES A PROJECT ON INFORMAL (NATURAL)/FORMAL (DATA BASE QUERY) LANGUAGE
MAPPING. A BASIS WAS DEVELOPED FOR PROCESSING ENGLISH-LANGUAGE REQUESTS FOR
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FROM AN EXISTING DBMS (DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM). THE
ROLE OF EACH WORD IN THE NATURAL-LANGUAGE QUERY WAS IDENTIFIED BY 2 SEPARATE
METHODS-A LEARNING ALGORITHM AND A STATISTICAL TECHNIQUE. THE PROGRAMME WAS
RUN WITH A SET OF 400 SENTENCES FROM A BASIC SCIENCE BOOK. THE RESULTS, WHICH
WERE JUDGED TO BE ENCOURAGING, ARE DISCUSSED.

A PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHM FOR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR SEARCHING.
     
A DETERMINISTIC NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR SEARCH ALGORITHM IS MODIFIED SO THAT THE
USER CAN SPECIFY A MAXIMUM TOLERABLE LEVEL OF ERROR. THIS TOLERANCE ALLOWS
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE ALGORITHM TO BE HANDLED PROBABILISTICALLY AND THIS, IN
TURN, ALLOWS AN IMPROVEMENT IN SEARCH SPEED DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF
ERROR PERMITTED. THUS, SEARCH TIME CAN BE TRADED OFF AGAINST SEARCH
EFFECTIVENESS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHM IS SUBSTANTIALLY
FASTER THAN THE DETERMINISTIC, WITH ONLY A VERY SMALL LOSS IN RETRIEVAL
QUALITY.

AN EXPERIMENT IN CLASSIFICATION: BASED ON WILLIAM GOFFMAN'S 'INDIRECT METHOD'
OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
BASED ON A PAPER PREPARED FOR A CLASSIFICATION THEORY COURSE AT CASE WESTERN
RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO, A REVISED VERSION OF WHICH WAS PRESENTED AT A
CANADIAN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON, ONTARIO, MAY 78.
DESCRIBES AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS OF DOCUMENT
CLASSES RETRIEVED USING GOFFMAN'S INDIRECT METHOD; HOW THESE CLASSES ARE
SIMILAR TO, OR DIFFERENT FROM, THE CLASSES OBTAINED WHEN A FACETED
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM IS APPLIED TO THE SAME SET OF DOCUMENTS; AND THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CLUSTERS OF TERMS WHICH INTER-RELATE A DEFINABLE CLASS
OF DOCUMENTS. A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 101 ENTRIES IN THE SUBJECT INDEXING SECTION
OF 2LISA1, 1976, WERE USED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE INDIRECT METHOD
COULD HAVE SOME MERIT IN SEARCH STRATEGIES IN COMPUTERISED INFORMATION STORAGE
AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS BASED ON KEYWORDS OR A CONTROLLED VOCABULARY.

THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE INDIAN LIBRARY SCENE. THE MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, AND
SERVICES OF MOST LIBRARIES IS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE, RESULTING IN GRAVE
MISALLOCATION AND UNDERUTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES. LITTLE MAJOR RESEARCH
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES ARE NOT MUCH HELP FOR
MANAGING AND OPERATING LIBRARIES EFFICIENTLY. THE MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND
TRAINING. THE COUNCIL WOULD BE SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE WELL-DEFINED
ROLES AND FUNCTIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF INDIAN LIBRARIANSHIP.

COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, FINAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS

LIBRARIANS WERE SENT QUESTIONNAIRES ON THE MAIN FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR
CHOICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A CAREER AND THEIR OPINIONS ON THE PROFESSION IN
RELATION TO TRAINING AND EDUCATION. 77 RESPONDED. 58 WERE 24-37 YEARS OLD; 59
WERE FEMALE; 68 HAD A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION; 49 CHOSE LIBRARIANSHIP AFTER THEY
FINISHED AT UNIVERSITY; MOST LANDED IN THE PROFESSION BY ACCIDENT; ALL
FAVOURED FURTHER PROFESSIONAL TRAINING (MOST PREFERRED TO GO ABROAD TO GAIN
WIDER EXPERIENCE AND ADSORB NEW IDEAS); 23 WOULD ADVISE THEIR CHILDREN TO BE
LIBRARIANS; 29 HAD PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS WHEN 1ST APPOINTED; 47 HAD
WORKED ONLY IN THEIR PRESENT LIBRARIES; AND MOST LIKED THEIR LIBRARIES BUT
EXPRESSED DISSATISFACTION WITH SALARY AND PROMOTION PROSPECTS.

FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.

REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THE
UK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WAS
DEVELOPED IN 1938, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19TH
CENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THE
CLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, AND
COULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODE
IS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.

CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY AND
THREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;
CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARY
DUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS
IN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILL
IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN
LIBRARIANSHIP. SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKING PARTY WOULD DO WELL TO REFER TO THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION CODE.

THE FOUNDING OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE (SAILIS) AS A NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATION HAS BEEN FAVOURABLY
RECEIVED NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. ITS STRUCTURE WILL BE DEVELOPED IN

FULL DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS AND REALISATION OF ASPIRATIONS OF EVERY GROUP IN

COMPUTERISED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL; AND THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF

LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.

IN THE USA, UK AND COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, LIBRARY SCIENCE IS NOW FULLY
ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND INCLUDED AMONGST UNIVERSITY
FACULTIES. SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY, HOWEVER, OPINION IN WEST GERMANY HAS BEEN
DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER LIBRARY SCIENCE HAS ITS OWN THEORETIC BASIS OR WHETHER
IT CONSISTS OF PURELY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. EXAMINATION OF THE RESPECTIVE
ARGUMENTS SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE CAN BE REGARDED AS AN APPLIED SCIENCE
CLOSELY LINKED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, E.G. INFORMATION SCIENCE,
COMMUNICATION, CYBERNETICS AND LINGUISTICS. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP EMPHASISED HITHERTO SHOULD PLAY ONLY A SUBORDINATE ROLE; THE
MAIN EMPHASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFICALLY BASED, ECONOMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
LINKED WITH RESEARCH. COLOGNE IS THE ONLY GERMAN UNIVERSITY POSSESSING A
LIBRARY SCIENCE FACULTY; MORE SUCH FACULTIES ARE NEEDED TO PRODUCE LIBRARIANS
OF THE REQUIRED CALIBRE.

COUNTY LIBRARIES' REGIONAL SERVICE-PROBLEMS AND LINES OF DEVELOPMENT.

THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY IN A PHASE OF STAGNATION, PARTLY DUE

DISCUSSION CONTINUES ON THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION, AND A
RATIONALISATION PROGRAMME, NOW OVER 10 YEARS OLD, IS ATTEMPTING TO APPORTION
FUNCTIONS AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. COUNTY LIBRARIES, WITH THEIR TRIPLE TASK OF ADVISORY SERVICE,
INTER-LIBRARY LENDING, AND MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE, ARE PARTICULARLY
VULNERABLE. THESE SERVICES, WHICH BENEFIT PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIES
AND INDIVIDUAL READERS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SOME RATIONALISATION
PROPOSALS. THE FIRST 2 COULD BE MAINTAINED AND IMPROVED IF COUNTY LIBRARIES
WERE MADE NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ATTACHED TO LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES. MOBILE
SERVICES ARE POORLY DEVELOPED IN NORWAY, PARTLY BECAUSE NOT ALL AREAS ARE
GEOGRAPHICALLY SUITABLE. A RESTRUCTURING OF TH E COUNTRY'S LIBRARY SYSTEM IS
URGENTLY NEEDED, AND COUNTY LIBRARIANS MUST EVALUATE THEIR OWN POSITION AND

LIBRARY SERVICES TO THE DISADVANTAGED: NOT QUITE WHAT THEY SEEM.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, BATH 1980.
DISCUSSES THE STANDARD OF THE PROVISION MADE BY UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES FOR THE
DISADVANTAGED, AND ARGUES THAT, WHILST LIBRARIES HAVE LARGELY RESPONDED TO THE
NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTIONALLY DISADVANTAGED (EG HOSPITAL PATIENTS, THE
HANDICAPPED, AND PRISON INMATES), THE SOCIALLY AND CULTURALLY DISADVANTAGED
HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED. IDENTIFIES A BASIC DICHOTOMY WHICH HAS 2 ASPECTS:
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN LEVELS OF PROVISION FOR VARIOUS DISADVANTAGED GROUPS;
AND THE DISPARITY BETWEEN SERVICE TO THE DISADVANTAGED AND SERVICE TO THE
COMMUNITY AT LARGE. REPORTS CRITICISMS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE INADEQUACY
OF THE WORK DONE BY LIBRARIES WITH ETHNIC MINORITIES, IN DEPRIVED AREAS, AND
WITH RELATION TO FUNCTIONAL LITERACY AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF READING.
STRESSES THE NEED FOR THE PROVISION OF COURSES ON, AND THE INITIATION OF
RESEARCH INTO, LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISADVANTAGED.

CAN THE LEAN YEARS GIVE CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES NEW OPPORTUNITIES?.

THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY'S MAIN TASKS REMAIN THOSE OF A CENTURY AGO:- TO
ENCOURAGE APTITUDES AND SKILLS, TO DISSEMINATE KNOWLEDGE, BOTH THROUGH FICTION
AND FACTUAL BOOKS, TO PROVIDE EXPERIENCE, WHETHER FROM INFORMATIVE
NON-FICTION, SATISFYING THE CHILD'S CURIOSITY, OR FROM FICTION, ALLOWING FOR
EMOTIONAL IDENTIFICATION, TO EDUCATE, ESPECIALLY IDEOLOGICALLY. SOME NORWEGIAN
COMMUNITIES STILL MAINTAIN STRICT ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS BOOK SELECTION
STANDARDS; LIBRARIANS MUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THEIR OWN SELECTION CRITERIA.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS MUST PUBLICISE THEIR WORK AND PROBLEMS, COOPERATING
WHERE POSSIBLE WITH THE MASS MEDIA, AND MAKE THE 1980S A DECADE OF
OPPORTUNITY.

FUNCTION.

CONCLUSIONS FROM A SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE HELD AT
LEANGKOLLEN, NORWAY, JULY 80, INCLUDED THE SCHOOL LIBRARY'S ALL-EMBRACING
FUNCTION; THE PRE-EMINENCE OF DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN SCANDINAVIA; THE NEED
FOR NORWEGIAN AUTHORITIES TO CARRY OUT THE INTENTIONS OF THE LIBRARY ACT; AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES' IMPORTANT ROLE IN SCANDINAVIAN CULTURAL COOPERATION. TOPICS
INCLUDED A FORWARD VIEW OF THE SCHOOL'S AIMS AND CURRICULUM; THE CHALLENGE OF

REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT 2 EXTRA PERMANENT STAFF AND
5 PART-TIME STAFF SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. THE SURVEY ALSO MADE RECOMMENDATION FOR

CONDITIONS AND CLOSE PROXIMITY BETWEEN UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AND LIBRARY
SERVICES. THE COORDINATION PROGRAMME AIMS AT, AND HAS PARTIALLY REALISED THE
INTEGRATION OF MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES INTO 28 LIBRARY COMPLEXES WITH
52 INDEPENDANT LIBRARY UNITS. ONE IMPORTANT MEASURE IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A

REVENUE SHARING AND STATE FUNDING IN INDIANA: PROSPECTS IMPROVE FOR PUBLIC

IN THE EARLY 70S THE FISCAL OUTLOOK FOR INDIANA'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
ABYSMALLY DEPRESSING, WITH MOST LIBRARIES HAVING NO OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS. HOWEVER, AS THE DECADE
PROGRESSED, SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BILLS FAVOURABLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE
ENACTED. THESE FOLLOWED THE REVENUE SHARING ACT OF 1972, WHICH PERMITTED
GOVERNMENT UNITS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEIR
OWN REVENUES WERE EXPENDED. IN 1978, REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS INCREASED
DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS' SECOND ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ACCESS TO REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS, WITH THE PASSAGE OF
SENATE-ENROLLED ACT NO. 208. THE OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK FOR THE 80S IS TEMPERED

MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

THE MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEM IS NOT UNIQUE, BUT JUST A SIMPLER VERSION OF THE
MINI AND MAINFRAME. IT IS ONLY CHEAPER BECAUSE LESS IS PROVIDED, THE
FACILITIES ARE INADEQUATE FOR MANY OPERATIONS, AND IF SIGNIFICANT ONCE-OFF
PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT IS REQUIRED, MOST COST ADVANTAGES OF A MICRO SYSTEM MAY
BE LOST. DISCUSSES QUESTIONS WHICH SHOULD BE RAISED WHEN CONSIDERING MICRO
COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION

HAVE ALSO BEEN ACTIVE AS PHILOSOPHERS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE LIBRARIAN AND
THE PHILOSOPHER MUST SHARE A NUMBER OF COMMON CHARACTERISTICS. THE MOST
STRIKING OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS IS THE UNBOUNDED THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE. IN
ADDITION, ALTHOUGH COURSES OF STUDY ARE AVAILABLE IN BOTH DISCIPLINES, THE

ON FINNISH LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE.

THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA
OF ANY LIBRARY BUILDING, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECONDARY ACTIVITIES.
IN JYVASKYLA LIBRARY BUILDING, AS IN MANY FINNISH LIBRARY BUILDINGS, THE
ACTUAL LIBRARY IS ACCOMMODATED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR LEVEL. A COMPETITION FOR
A DESIGN IS NORMALLY ORGANIZED. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN JYVASKYLA. THIS IS
NOT THE WAY TO GET BEST RESULTS, BECAUSE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ARCHITECT
AND THE LIBRARIAN ONLY BEGINS AFTER THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE. AN ARCHITECT
SHOULD BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY AND THE LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY EXPERT AND THE
ARCHITECT SHOULD COOPERATE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING.

RESEARCH BEING PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED ON AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA.
SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE SPECIALISED RESEARCH INSTITUTES. SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION MUST BE SOUGHT IN LARGE GENERAL PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES, AND

PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES.

UNTIL WELL INTO THE 70S TRADITIONAL INFORMATION CHANNELS WERE USED WHEN
DEALING WITH INFORMATION ABOUT SOCIAL SCIENCES. THE EXPANSION OF RESEARCH IN
THE AREA NECESSITATED MORE PLANNED INFORMATION SERVICES. THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT
OF THESES IS DUE TO THE LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES, TO THE SPECIAL NATURE OF

THEIR FIELD, TO THE UNWILLINGNESS OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TO USE INFORMATION
SERVICES, AND TO THE LACK OF STANDARDISED TERMINOLOGY IN THE FIELD.

INFORMATION COLLECTED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES CAN BE EXCHANGED BETWEEN
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. THE MORE MECHANICAL THIS EXCHANGE IS THE MORE ECONOMICAL
AND FASTER IT WILL BE. UNISIST NOW ALSO COVERS SOCIAL SCIENCES. A PLAN
PUBLISHED IN 1972 INCLUDES UNESCO'S PROGRAMME FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES. UNESCO ALSO SUPPORTS FINANCIALLY SOME
PROJECTS IN THE FIELD, INCLUDING ECSSID PROGRAMME. IN 1975 OECD MAPPED THE

(NOTE. ORIGINAL PRESENTATION IN FRENCH; ENGLISH VERSION PUBLISHED AT AUTHOR'S
REQUEST.) THE INTERNATIONAL POPULATION INFORMATION NETWORK (POPIN) IS BEING
ESTABLISHED IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASING RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF SUCH
INFORMATION, THE DESIRE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO BUILD THEIR OWN INFORMATION
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE NEED TO TIE TOGETHER ISOLATED ACTIVITIES TO MAXIMISE
BENEFITS. IT IS DEVELOPING AS A REGIONAL AND NATIONAL OPERATION WITH
ACTIVITIES INTEGRATED THROUGH A CENTRAL COORDINATING UNIT. THE 1ST MEETING OF
THE POPIN ADVISORY GROUP (SCHEDULED FOR EARLY 1980) WAS TO DISCUSS WAYS OF
IMPROVING INTERCONNECTIONS AMONG EXISTING POPULATION INFORMATION SYSTEMS;
RESOLVE PROBLEMS OF STANDARDISATION, UNIFORMITY, AND COORDINATION; AND REACH A

COMPUTER USE. THE ALGORITHM IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF THE SMALLEST BINARY
CODE FOR A GRAPH AND REQUIRES GENERATION OF ALL NUMBERINGS FOR A STRUCTURE
WHICH WILL PRODUCE THE CANONICAL FORM FOR THE ADJACENCY MATRIX. THE UNIQUE
ADJACENCY MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE (BINARY) NUMBER
REPRESENTING THE STRUCTURE WHEN ITS ROWS ARE READ FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND FROM
LEFT TO RIGHT. OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM IS ILLUSTRATED WITH A SELECTION OF
POLYCYCLIC STRUCTURES.

REGISTRATION-IDENTIFICATION OF CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS BASED ON LATTICE AND
EMPIRICAL FORMULA.

DATA FILES CONTAINING INFORMATION ON SOLID-STATE MATERIALS ARE EXPANDING
RAPIDLY. EACH YEAR SEVERAL THOUSAND NEW MATERIALS ARE CHARACTERISED BY X-RAY
DIFFRACTION TECHNIQUES. CONSEQUENTLY, COMPUTER PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED
TO REGISTER MATERIALS ENTERING LARGE DATA FILES. REGISTRATION BASED ON LATTICE
PARAMETERS AND EMPIRICAL FORMULA IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE. THE LATTICE IS
UNIQUELY REPRESENTED BY THE REDUCED CELL AND THE ELEMENTS IN THE FORMULA ARE
UNIQUELY SPECIFIED BY PRIME NUMBERS. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN APPLIED FOR SEVERAL
YEARS TO REGISTER NEW MATERIALS FOR THE CAMBRIDGE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DATA FILE
WHICH CONTAINS DATA ON MORE THAN 25,000 COMPOUNDS CONTAINING ORGANIC CARBON.
THE METHOD IS NOW BEING ADAPTED TO REGISTER MATERIALS FOR THE NBS CRYSTAL DATA

INFORMATION AND LITERATURE DEMAND.

BETWEEN 1970 AND 78 THE NUMBER OF ANNUAL LITERATURE ORDERS RECEIVED FROM
OUTSIDE BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE IN COLOGNE INCREASED BY NEARLY 400%
TO 210,000. SINCE COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICES EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY
DURING THIS PERIOD, THE LIBRARY NEEDED DETAILED INFORMATION ON REQUESTED
MATERIAL FOR FUTURE PLANNING, SO IN 1978 A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE
HELP OF THE DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION).
INFORMATION FROM 12 LIBRARIES WAS OBTAINED ON THE SOURCES OF ORDERED
LITERATURE, THE USE OF MATERIAL BY DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL GROUPS, THE USE OF
COMPUTER SERVICES, BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND ABSTRACTS, THE TYPES AND LANGUAGE OF
MATERIAL REQUIRED AND THE TYPE OF LIBRARY MAKING THE REQUEST. THE SURVEY'S
CENTRAL FINDING WAS THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPUTERISED INFORMATION
SERVICES CONSIDERABLY INFLUENCED USER DEMAND. LIBRARIES MUST CATER FOR THIS
AND THEIR FINANCING BODIES MUST SUPPORT THEM.

THE NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA UNION CATALOGUE OFFICE AT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
CENTRE PUBLISHED THE 1979 REPORT CONCERNING EXTERNAL LENDING AND BORROWING
STATISTICS. 175 LIBRARIES IN THE REGION WERE AUTHORISED LENDING LIBRARIES IN
1979. THE UNION CATALOGUE OFFICE SENT QUESTIONNAIRES TO 273 LIBRARIES,
DEPARTMENTS AND GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IN THE REGION. 270 OF THESE WERE COMPLETED AND
RETURNED. THE NUMBER OF INTER-LIBRARY LOANS LEVELLED OFF IN COMPARISON TO THE
HIGH 1976 FIGURES AND DROPPED IN SOME CASES. THERE WERE SOME EXCEPTIONS SUCH
AS THE COLOGNE ZENTRALBIBLIOTHEK DER MEDIZIN WHICH HAD A GROWTH RATE OF 13%.
THERE WAS A RISE IN BOOKS ORDERED BY LIBRARIES FROM OTHER LIBRARIES OF 3.7%. A
CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF BOOKS LENT TO OTHER LIBRARIES IN
WEST GERMANY AND ABROAD WAS EVIDENT. MORE BOOKS WERE BORROWED BY THE REGIONAL
LIBRARIES THAN WERE SUPPLIED BY THEM AND THE FIGURES FOR BOOKS SUPPLIED
DROPPED IN COMPARISON TO EARLIER STATISTICS.

ITS PILOT SURVEY. THE GROUP INCLUDED LIBRARIANS FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF
LIBRARIES. THE PURPOSES OF THE PILOT WAS TO RECOMMEND THAT A COMPILATION OF A
SUBJECT HEADING LIST SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AND TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE WORK. THE LIST WOULD SERVE ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES AND
WOULD BE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN A CLASSIFICATION. A THESAURUS STRUCTURE WOULD BE
BEST FOR THE PURPOSE. THE LIST SHOULD INCLUDE BETWEEN 10,000 AND 20,000 TERMS.
A WORKING GROUP SHOULD BE SET UP BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION THIS YEAR. THE
BUDGET FOR THE WORK LASTING 3 YEARS IS ESTIMATED AT 385,000 FINN MARKS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUBJECT INDEX FOR THE DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.

IN MAY 80 THE JOINT WORKING PARTIES ON THE DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND THE
DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTRE PUBLISHED THEIR FINAL REPORT CONTAINING
PROPOSALS FOR A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE NETHERLANDS BASED ON BRINKMANN'S
CATALOGUE OF BOOKS. IN VIEW OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF TERMS USED IN THE SUBJECT
INDEX OF BRINKMANN'S CATALOGUE IT WAS PROPOSED TO ADOPT THE THESAURUS OF
HEADINGS DEVELOPED BY THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH
CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) WITH THE ADDITION OF UDC AND SISO
CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS TO EACH ENTRY. A TEST-RUN HAS IDENTIFIED A CORE OF SOME
3,500 HEADINGS WHICH WILL BE INPUT INTO THE DATA BASE TO PROVIDE A SUBJECT
INDEX TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY. THE SYSTEM WILL BECOME OPERATIONAL ON 1 JAN 81.

LIBRARIES: CULTURAL ROLE AND THE PROBLEMS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.

CONSISTS OF PART OF K.I. RUBINSKII'S 1909 LECTURE AT KHARKOV UNIVERSITY.
LIBRARIES DESERVE SERIOUS STUDY AS FACTORS IN HUMAN CULTURE. THEY ARE A
COUNTRY'S MOST VALUABLE ASSET. LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BECOME A UNIVERSITY
SUBJECT AS IT EVOLVES THE BEST METHODS OF DISSEMINATING KNOWLEDGE.
LIBRARIANSHIP NEEDS TO STUDY THE WORK OF PEOPLE'S AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
LIBRARY HISTORY, STATISTICS, BOOK CONSERVATION, LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND STAFF
TRAINING. LIBRARIES MUST HELP ALL THOSE TURNING TO THEM AS A SCHOOL. HOWEVER,
UNTRAINED STAFF WILL HAMPER THIS. THE PEOPLE'S WAGES CREATED LIBRARIES, USE OF
THEM IS THEIR RIGHT.

REVIEWS BRIEFLY THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN ARTICLES ON TYPOLOGY OF LIBRARIES
PUBLISHED IN NAUCHNYE I TEKHNICHESKIE BIBLIOTEKI SSSR IN THE PAST AND

THAT: (1) 'LIBRARY ACTIVITIES' AND NOT 'LIBRARY TYPES' SHOULD BE USED AS THE
BASIS FOR SCIENTIFIC TYPISATION OF LIBRARIES; (2) A NUMBER OF LIBRARY SCIENCE
DISCIPLINES HAVE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH ARE
BASED ON VARIOUS DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION PRINCIPLES; (3) THEORIES OF
SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP MUST BE BUILT ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE ACTIVITIES
UNDERTAKEN BY SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND NOT ON THE 'TYPES' OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES;
(4) GENERAL LIBRARY SCIENCE REPRESENTS THE NUCLEUS ESSENTIAL FOR FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE.

THE CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN AND CENSORSHIP: ANOTHER VIEW.

A REPLY TO 'LIBERTY, DEMOCRACY AND CENSORSHIP' THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN', CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN (5) 1981, 29-38 (SEE PREVIOUS
ABSTRACT). RAISES THE FOLLOWING POINTS' THE SECURE BELIEVER CAN MAKE A
DISCRIMINATING JUDGEMENT IN SELECTING MATERIALS, UTILIZING ALL THE MEANS AT
HIS DISPOSAL, EVEN IF IT MEANS INCLUDING THINGS HE STRONGLY DISAGREES WITH;
LIBRARIANS MUST BE ALERT TO THE POWER OF EVIL, BUT TO CONCEAL IT IS NOT TO
DESTROY IT; THE LIBRARIAN SPENDS PUBLIC MONEY, GENERATED FROM PEOPLE OF MANY
FAITHS, WITH DIFFERENT CULTURAL AND MORAL BACKGROUNDS; LIBRARIANS NEED TO BE,
AND TO BE SEEN AS, OPEN PERSONS WHO ARE CONSISTENTLY GRAPPLING WITH THE ISSUES
OF REAL LIFE AS THEY ARE REFLECTED BROADLY IN THE PUBLISHING WORLD; AND
FINALLY, LIBRARIANS SHOULD BEA LIFE-ENHANCING AND A LIFE-AFFIRMING INFLUENCE
AND THE LIBRARY CAN BE A GENUINE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS WHERE 'GOOD' BOOKS MAY
COMPETE WITH THE BAD SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE TOGETHER.

A SEARCH FOR INFORMATION MAN.

EXAMINES THE NOTION OF 'INFORMATION MAN' BY ANALOGY WITH 'ECONOMIC MAN' AND
SEEKS TO DISCOVER HOW THE CONCEPT HAS BEEN USED IMPLICITLY IN USER STUDIES AND
BIBLIOMETRICS. THE CONCLUSION IS REACHED THAT A PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION OF
INFORMATION MAN IS TO BE FOUND IN SUCH STUDIES AND THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE
EXAMINED. MORE SOPHISTICATED VERSIONS OF INFORMATION MAN ARE SEEN TO BE
EMERGING FROM SOME RECENT WORK.

INFORMATION BANKS, DATA BANKS, AND DATA BASES' AN ATTEMPT AT CLARIFICATION OF
TERMS.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980 CANADIAN CONFERENCE WHICH DERIVES A STRUCTURAL
TYPOLOGY FOR INFORMATION BANKS FROM THE PRELIMINARY CONSTRUCTION OF TYPOLOGIES
OF DOCUMENTARY INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTARY ELEMENTS. THE 1ST TYPOLOGY DEVELOPS
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTARY INFORMATION; THE 2ND
LEADS TO REDEFINITION OF THE CONCEPTS OF RECORDS, DOCUMENTS, AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ENTRIES. THE CREATION OF THE INFORMATION BANK TYPOLOGY LEADS
TO EXPLANATION OF THE DATA BASE CONCEPT, AND IN CONCLUSION A DEFINITION OF
DOCUMENTATION IS ADVANCED. THE ARGUMENT IS ILLUSTRATED BY REFERENCE TO
CANADIAN EXAMPLES.

THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH
CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE).

TEXT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH DICK REUMER, DIRECTOR OF THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK
EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM, ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CENTRE.
REUMER BELIEVES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS FACING LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS IN 1982 ARE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO REDUCE SUBSIDIES TO
PUBLIC LIBRARIES BY 15% AND THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION RELATING TO THE PUBLIC
SERVICES, WHICH WILL REPLACE THE PRESENT PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT. FOR THE NBLC THE
NEW LEGISLATION WILL MEAN THE DECENTRALISATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES THROUGHOUT
THE REGIONS AND CLOSER COOPERATION AMONGST LIBRARIES IN THE SAME AREA. TO
CELEBRATE THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NBLC A JUBILEE CONGRESS IS TO BE HELD AT
WHICH THE CENTRE'S SERVICES WILL COME UNDER CLOSE EXAMINATION AND WILL BE MORE
ACTIVELY PROMOTED TO THE PUBLIC.

TRAINING ALSO VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE AND MAY BE A LIBRARY COLLEGE, A
TRAINING LIBRARY OR A POLYTECHNIC. THERE IS NO CLEARLY DEFINED CAREER
STRUCTURE FOR ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS OR ASSISTANTS WHICH CAUSES DIFFICULTIES
WITHIN LIBRARIES WHEN ALLOCATING DUTIES AND DIFFICULTIES IN SALARY GRADES. IT

WISER FROM EXPERIENCE: A STUDY OF PRACTICAL WORK AS AN ELEMENT OF LIBRARY
EDUCATION.

LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSES HAVE FOR A LONG TIME INCLUDED PERIODS OF PRACTICAL WORK
TO ENABLE STUDENTS TO APPLY THEIR THEORETICAL TRAINING TO PRACTICAL SITUATIONS
IN LIBRARIES. SUCH PERIODS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF 'SELF-ORIENTATION' PERIODS,
PROVIDING THE STUDENT WITH ALL-ROUND EXPERIENCE OF LIBRARY TECHNIQUES OR
'EXPERIENCE' PERIODS, DURING WHICH THE STUDENT MAY CARRY OUT DETAILED STUDY OF
A PARTICULAR TOPIC. IN THE NETHERLANDS MOST LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSES ARE TOO
SHORT TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO GAIN MORE THAN A BRIEF VIEW OF LIBRARY ROUTINES IN
PRACTICE. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS OFTEN FAIL TO DERIVE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM
THEIR PRACTICAL TRAINING BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE PREPARATION BY THE LIBRARY
SCHOOLS AND THE HEAVY WORKLOAD OF COURSE TUTORS. THERE SHOULD BE REGULAR
CONSULTATION BETWEEN STUDENT, COURSE-TUTOR AND TRAINING LIBRARY TO ENSURE THAT
ALL ASPECTS OF PRACTICAL TRAINING ARE BEING COVERED.

STAGNATION IN THE KIBBUTZ LIBRARY.

2 CHARACTERISTICS OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIES ARE GIVING CAUSE FOR CONCERN;
DECENTRALISATION; AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIANS. DECENTRALISATION
HAS HISTORIC AND SOCIAL CAUSES. FORMERLY, MOST LIBRARIANS WERE VOLUNTEERS AND
VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE KIBBUTZ POPULATION HAD SEPARATE AREAS OF RESIDENCE AND
ACTIVITY. MODERN KIBBUTZ SOCIETY AND ORGANISATION HAVE CHANGED, BUT MANY SMALL
LIBRARIES HAVE REMAINED IN EXISTENCE. DECENTRALISATION HAS MANY DRAWBACKS'
INEFFICIENCY, AREAS OF INTEREST NOT COVERED BY ANY LIBRARY, INCONVENIENCE OF
MANY READERS AND LACK OF A STRONG LIBRARY THAT COULD BECOME A FOCAL POINT IN
THE CULTURAL LIFE OF THE KIBBUTZ. THE 24 LIBRARIANS SERVING IN THE KIBBUTZIM
SURVEYED AVERAGED 53.3 YEARS, ONLY 5 OF THEM BEING YOUNGER THAN 50. THIS
SITUATION RULES OUT MUCH IN THE WAY OF DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION. CALLS FOR A

SHOULD HOPE BE ABANDONED BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS?.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE WORD 'PUBLIC' MUST BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN
CONNECTION WITH LIBRARIES. PARTICULAR PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED IN SELECTING FICTION
AND LEISURE MATERIAL. READERS DISLIKE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF TRIVIAL MATERIAL AS
MUCH AS THE ELITIST APPROACH BUT THE ILLITERACY OF SOME SECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC
IS PREFERABLE TO THE TOTAL ABSTINENCE OF THE NON-READER. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
MUST BRING A NEW QUALITY TO ITS PUBLIC SERVICE, EXERCISING A CORRECTIVE
FUNCTION IN RESPECT OF BOOK MARKET TRENDS. LIBRARIANS MUST MOUNT AN OFFENSIVE
ACTION IN PURSUIT OF THE SENSIBLE, SOCIAL AND HUMANE ASPECTS OF THEIR SERVICE.
IT IS DANGEROUS TO ATTACH TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO STATISTICS. LITERATURE SHOULD
BE PROVIDED THAT CROSSES ALL ARBITRARY BORDERS AND STIMULATES THE MIND.

SOME COMMENTS ON THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIANSHIP.

SINCE WORLD WAR II THERE HAS BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH IN THE NETHERLANDS
IN THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING MEDICAL CARE, SOCIAL WELFARE
AND EDUCATION. THIS GROWTH HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED IN AN ORDERLY MANNER BUT HAS
COME ABOUT BY THE SUDDEN EXPANSION OF SEPARATE SECTORS. IN THE LAST 10 YEARS
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES HAS BECOME A SUBJECT FOR MUCH DISCUSSION IN THE
DUTCH PARLIAMENT WITH THE RESULT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE PROVISION FOR
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO HAVE A GREATER SAY IN THE RUNNING OF THESE SERVICES.
IN FUTURE FACTORS WHICH WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES INCLUDE
THE SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE REDUCED
BIRTH-RATE. TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES A REFORM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES IS
NECESSARY.

USEFUL ADJUNCTS TO THE CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION. THE CARNEGIE
CORPORATION OF NEW YORK PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE FREE LIBRARY
MOVEMENT WAS SET UP IN SYDNEY. MASS DEMAND FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS NOT REALLY
A MOTIVE FORCE IN THE REVIVAL. WORLD WAR 2 EMPHASISED THE NEED TO PRESERVE
DEMOCRACY THROUGH EDUCATION AND ALSO ESTABLISHED THE IDEA THAT CULTURE WAS NOT
THE PRESERVE OF THE INTELLECTUAL ELITE ALONE. POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION BROUGHT
WITH IT A TIDE OF LARGELY BRITISH IMMIGRANTS WHO HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS OF
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES. THE IMPETUS PROVIDED BY THE WAR WAS SHORT LIVED,
HOWEVER, AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE FORCED TO STAND ALONE. THIS TIME THEY WERE

HAMBURG PUBLIC LIBRARIES-DRAFT DEVELOPMENT PLAN.

THE 10 YEAR PLAN, PUBLISHED IN OCT 81, CONCENTRATES ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND
LOOKS AT LIBRARY PROVISION IN THE CITY IN THE LIGHT OF THE EVER-INCREASING
OUTPUT OF BOOKS AND NON-BOOK MATERIALS AND OF HAMBURG'S GROWING IMMIGRANT
POPULATION. DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY PROVISION HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH DEMAND,
PARTICULARLY FOR SPECIAL CATEGORIES (E.G. HANDICAPPED PEOPLE). WAYS OF
COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SYSTEMS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES NEEDS REAPPRAISAL. THE ROLE OF THE BRANCH LIBRARY
IN MEETING THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY MUST BE EXAMINED AND
BETTER ACCOMMODATION IS NEEDED IF THE SERVICE IS TO EXPAND. THE INTRODUCTION
OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES SHOULD RELEASE STAFF TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE

AN OUTLINE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SENCKENBERG LIBRARY IN FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN.

THE LIBRARY IS PART OF A FOUNDATION ESTABLISHED IN 1763 BY DR. JOHANN
CHRISTIAN SENCKENBERG. IN THE 19TH CENTURY, SEVERAL LEARNED SOCIETIES
AMALGAMATED THEIR LIBRARIES WITH IT; THE STOCKS, COMPRISING WORKS IN NATURAL
SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, WERE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY LOCAL DOCTORS AND MEMBERS OF
THE NEWLY FORMED ASSOCIATION. IN 1907 THE LIBRARY WAS OPENED TO THE PUBLIC;
NEW PREMISES WERE USED AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF EMPLOYED. AFTER A PERIOD OF
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY DURING WORLD WAR I, THE JOHANN-WOLFGANG-GOETHE UNIVERSITY
TOOK OVER FINANCIAL CONTROL OF THE LIBRARY. IN 1947 A NEW AGREEMENT WAS MADE,
GIVING THE UNIVERSITY MORE POWERS IN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION AND IN 1966 THE
LIBRARY WAS MOVED INTO NEW PREMISES WITH THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF FORESTRY AND TIMBER INDUSTRY DATES BACK TO
THE 18TH CENTURY. A SCHOOL OF MINING WAS FOUNDED BY KING KARL III IN 1735.
THIS SCHOOL DEVELOPED AND FROM 1770 ALSO TAUGHT FORESTRY SCIENCE. IN 1808 IT

LIBRARY WHICH EXPANDED TO COVER NEW SUBJECT AREAS. THE INSTITUTE BECAME THE
ACADEMY OF MINING AND FORESTRY IN 1846 AND ONLY ACQUIRED UNIVERSITY STATUS IN
1934. THE LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY THE 1ST WORLD WAR,
INADEQUATE BUILDINGS AND LACK OF STAFF. WITH THE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY A
NEW LIBRARY WAS ALSO PLANNED. THE NEW LIBRARY BUILDING WAS OPENED IN 1977. IT

LIBRARIES, RADIO AND TELEVISION IN WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.

THERE ARE 3 MAIN WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES AND THE MEDIA CAN COOPERATE. RADIO
AND TELEVISION CAN BROADCAST RELEVANT PROGRAMMES SUCH AS DISCUSSIONS,
INTERVIEWS WITH AUTHORS AND STORY READINGS. LIBRARIANS CAN USE TELEVISION AND
RADIO TO FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON PARTICULAR ISSUES,
RECOMMENDING PROGRAMMES AND LINKING BOOK DISPLAYS TO THEM. ALTERNATIVELY,
LIBRARIANS CAN BE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF PROGRAMMES AND CAN
USE THEM TO PUBLICISE POPULAR LITERATURE AND AUTHORS. A SURVEY, UNDERTAKEN IN
ROSTOV, SHOWED HOW EFFECTIVE THIS FORM OF COOPERATION COULD BE, BUT IT IS
OFTEN DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.

THE UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARY: LAMONT AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.

THIS REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARIES, THE HISTORICAL

OUT THAT A LONG TRADITION OF LACK OF CONCERN FOR UNDERGRADUATE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
NEEDS WAS BROKEN DRAMATICALLY IN 1949 BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF LAMONT LIBRARY,
THE HARVARD UNDERGRADUATE FACILITY. ALTHOUGH DESIGNED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS UNIQUE
TO HARVARD, LAMONT WAS AN EXEMPLARY CONSTRUCTION THAT SOON CAPTURED THE
IMAGINATION OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY WORLD. IT BECAME THE MODEL FOR A RASH OF
NEW LIBRARIES AIMED AT SATISFYING 'UNIQUE' UNDERGRADUATE NEEDS. THESE
LIBRARIES PROLIFERATED DURING THE 50S AND 60S, A PERIOD OF ACCELERATED GROWTH
IN ACADEME. BY THE 70S, HOWEVER, THE GENERAL FINANCIAL RETRENCHMENT OF
AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAD VIRTUALLY HALTED NEW CONSTRUCTION.
FURTHER, THE THESIS THAT PRESUMED THE NEEDS OF UNDERGRADUATES TO BE SOMEHOW
'DIFFERENT', AS WELL AS THE ADVISABI LITY OF FACILITIES EFFECTIVELY
SEGREGATING THEM FROM THE REST OF THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY, CAME UNDER ATTACK IN
THE PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE. FEW UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARIES WERE BUILT DURING
THIS PERIOD AND SEVERAL WERE CLOSED OR CONVERTED TO OTHER USES. REPORT NOT

DETERMINE HOW WELL THEY CAN MEET USERS' NEEDS FOR FEDERAL DOCUMENTS. RESULTS
INDICATE THESE LIBRARIES SPEND AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT $750 A YEAR ON DOCUMENTS,
ACQUIRE VERY LITTLE FREE MATERIAL, AND INCORPORATE MOST DOCUMENTS INTO THE
REGULAR COLLECTION OR THE VERTICAL FILE. ALTHOUGH MOST ACQUIRE THE BASIC
DOCUMENT REFERENCE SOURCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS, VERY FEW MAKE ANY
SIGNIFICANT USE OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN. APPARENTLY MOST CANNOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO
DOCUMENTS EQUAL TO THAT OFFERED BY EVEN SMALL DEPOSITORIES.

LIBRARIES AND COLLECTIONS-THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.

THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY (AAS) IS A LEARNED SOCIETY FOUNDED IN 1812 IN
WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS. THE SOCIETY MAINTAINS A RESEARCH LIBRARY OF AMERICAN
HISTORY AND CULTURE IN ORDER TO COLLECT, PRESERVE AND MAKE AVAILABLE FOR STUDY
THE PRINTED RECORD OF THE USA. WITH HOLDINGS NUMBERING CLOSE TO 3 MILLION
BOOKS, PAMPHLETS, BROADSIDES, MANUSCRIPTS, PRINTS, MAPS AND NEWSPAPERS, THIS
LIBRARY PRESERVES THE LARGEST SINGLE COLLECTION OF PRINTED SOURCE MATERIAL
RELATING TO THE HISTORY, LITERATURE AND CULTURE OF THE USA.

LOCAL COLLECTIONS IN BRITISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE LIBRARIAN IN CHARGE OF LOCAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS IN UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES
COLLECTIONS WILL NEED TO SCAN LOCAL PAPERS AND JOURNALS FOR REFERENCES TO
LOCAL EVENTS AND FOR REVIEWS OF BOOKS AND OTHER MATERIAL OF INTEREST. HE
SHOULD MAKE CONTACT WITH LOCAL FIRMS AND ASSOCIATIONS IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN
THEIR PUBLICATIONS AND SCAN THE SALES CATALOGUES OF SECOND-HAND BOOKSELLERS
AND AUCTIONEERS FOR OUT-OF-PRINT MATERIAL. THE MAIN PROBLEM FACING LOCAL
COLLECTIONS IS THE LACK OF QUALIFIED STAFF, WITHOUT WHICH THE LIBRARY CANNOT
PROVIDE A SERVICE TO THE GROWING NUMBER OF INTERESTED ENQUIRERS.

PERIODICALS IN OUR LIBRARIES.

PERIODICALS ARE VALUABLE IN EVERY LIBRARY SINCE THEY ARE TOPICAL MATERIAL AND
ATTRACT NEW READERS WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE USE THE LIBRARY. PERIODICAL
SELECTION IS IMPORTANT; A LIST IS INCLUDED OF 42 GERMAN LANGUAGE PERIODICALS
ON ALL SUBJECTS, FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN, WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED SUITABLE
FOR A ROMAN CATHOLIC PARISH LIBRARY. PERIODICAL SELECTION BY A TEAM IS
ESSENTIAL; THE TEAM COULD INCLUDE THE PRIEST, THE PARISH COUNCIL AND
REPRESENTATIVES FROM OTHER INTERESTED BODIES. SELECTION SHOULD TAKE PARTICULAR
COMMUNITY INTERESTS INTO ACCOUNT BUT EXCESSIVE SPECIALISATION SHOULD BE
AVOIDED. FINANCE IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM; SOME INDIVIDUAL READERS MIGHT BE WILLING
TO HELP. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUBLICISE THE LIBRARY'S PERIODICAL STOCKS.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DENSITY-OF-USE RANKING AND RAW USE
RANKING OF LIBRARY JOURNAL USE.

REPORTS OF JOURNAL TITLES RANKED BY USE WITH SPACE AND COST INFORMATION
INCLUDED FOR EACH TITLE CAN PROVIDE A MEANS FOR MAKING CERTAIN OBJECTIVE
JOURNAL COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. EACH TITLE CAN BE ASSESSED IN
RELATION TO THE OTHERS AND THE DATA FOR ALL TITLES CAN BE CUMULATED SO THAT
DECISIONS CAN BE MADE AT VARIOUS CUTOFF POINTS. SIMPLE RANKING OF TITLES BY
RAW USE (RUR) MAY BE INADEQUATE AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED BY SOME MEASURE TO
ALLOW FOR HOW MUCH OF THE TITLE IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER AT THE TIME OF THE
COLLECTION OF THE USE DATA. IF THE RAW-USE FREQUENCY OF A TITLE IS DIVIDED BY
THE ACTUAL LINEAR SHELF SPACE OF THE TITLE'S FILE, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE'
FREQUENCY IS OBTAINED. IF THESE FREQUENCIES ARE THEN RANKED, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE
RANK' (DUR) IS FORMED. SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUR AND DUR HAVE BEEN
ANALYSED.

AUDIO-VISUAL DEVELOPMENTS RELEVANT TO LIBRARIES.

MOST ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY ALREADY HAVE MANY AUDIO-VISUAL (AV)
AIDS AT THEIR DISPOSAL' MICROFILMS, SOUND RECORDINGS IN VARIOUS FORMS, MAPS,
POSTERS AND INDIVIDUAL CUBICLES FOR LISTENING TO SOUND RECORDINGS. TODAY THE
MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF AV AIDS IN LIBRARIES IS NOT THE INTRODUCTION OF EVERY
AVAILABLE NEW AV DEVELOPMENT INTO THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY BUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF
A MEDIA SECTION IN THE LIBRARY WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS
WITHIN THE LIBRARY E.G. THE MUSIC DEPARTMENT. NEW DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS
VIEWDATA, VIDEO, CABLE TELEVISION AND COMPUTER LEARNING AIDS CANNOT BE
AUTOMATICALLY INTEGRATED INTO LIBRARIES. VARIOUS FACTORS MUST BE TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION WHEN SELECTING A NEW AV AID FOR A LIBRARY; THE INFORMATION
VALUE, ECONOMIC ASPECTS, AND THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL STAFF TRAINING WHICH
WILL BE NECESSARY TO MAKE FULL USE OF THE AIDS.

WHAT BOOKS DO PEOPLE NEED?.

SINCE LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES ARE WELL EDUCATED, THERE IS ALWAYS A DANGER THAT
THEY MAY CATER SOLELY FOR THE WISHES OF AN ELITE MINORITY AND, BY EXCLUDING
EPHEMERAL LITERATURE FROM STOCK, DISCOURAGE MANY OTHER PEOPLE FROM USING THE
LIBRARY. THE WEST GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY PLAN OF 1973 STATES CLEARLY THAT
LIBRARIES MUST CATER FOR EVERYONE, EVEN IF PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY LIMITED
BUDGETS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EMPHEMERAL LITERATURE HAS A RELAXING
EFFECT ON MANY PEOPLE, IN CONTRAST TO THE STIMULATING EFFECT CAUSED BY MORE
DEMANDING WORKS. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO EXCLUDE LESS VALUABLE
MATERIAL, SUCH AS WORKS INVOLVING PORNOGRAPHY AND VIOLENCE AND THEN TO INCLUDE
SOME TRIVIA IF CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF READER STRUCTURE DEMANDS IT.

THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (1)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
PRESERVATION AND CHANGE.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND
THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, OCT 80. LIBRARY
SERVICES MUST REACT AND DEVELOP IN RELATION TO SOCIAL CHANGE. THEY MUST CATER
FOR THE NEEDS OF BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES, WHERE TOWN AND COUNTRY
PLANNING HAS SO OFTEN FAILED. WORKING HOURS ARE SHORTER NOW THAN IN THE PAST,
SO LIBRARIES MUST DEVELOP FACILITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RECREATIONAL READING
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MASS MEDIA. CHILDREN USE LIBRARIES MORE THAN ADULTS
BUT THE BIRTH RATE HAS FALLEN AND THERE ARE MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE
COMMUNITY TODAY THAN BEFORE; THIS, HOWEVER, IS NO EXCUSE FOR A DECLINE IN
LIBRARY STANDARDS. LIBRARIES MUST BECOME COMMUNICATION CENTRES, IN PARTICULAR
TO HELP THE MANY PEOPLE LIVING ALONE AND THE 4 MILLION FOREIGNERS IN WEST
GERMANY.

THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (II)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
PRESERVATION AND CHANGE.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND
THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, BIELEFELD, OCT 80.
(FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 PREVIOUS ABSTRACT). LIBRARIES EXIST TO FULFIL HUMAN NEEDS
FOR EDUCATION, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND GENERAL SELF-DEVELOPMENT. FUTURE
LIBRARY PLANNING MUST PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BALANCE OF STATIONARY AND
MOBILE ELEMENTS IN A SYSTEM, TO LOCAL NEEDS AND TO ADULT EDUCATION. BOTH
QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND VOLUNTARY HELPERS CAN MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO
LIBRARY SERVICES; STAFF OF HIGH CALIBRE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MEDIA
THEMSELVES OR ADVANCED TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT. TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY IN A LIBRARY
CAN ALIENATE THE READERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO GENERALISE ABOUT MINIMUM
STANDARDS; EACH LIBRARY NEEDS ITS OWN IDENTITY.

THE INNOVATION MOVEMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES 1981-85.

UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE EAST GERMAN MINISTRY OF CULTURE, DAS ZENTRALINSTITUT
FUR BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (CENTRAL INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE) IS ORGANISING A
PROGRAMME ENCOURAGING LIBRARY STAFF TO DEVISE NEW TECHNICAL AIDS, WORK
PROCESSES AND ECONOMIC MEASURES. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT SUCH INNOVATIONS
CAN BE APPLIED ON A SCALE MUCH WIDER THAN THAT OF THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT,
DETERMINING FACTORS BEING THE CONDITIONS, STRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL LEVEL OF
EACH LIBRARY. THE INNOVATION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A NEW INVENTION BUT SHOULD
RATHER BE A BETTER USE OF EXISTING MATERIAL OR IDEAS. THOSE TESTING THE
INNOVATIONS MUST HAVE A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SUBJECT. MORE PARTICIPATION
MUST BE ENCOURAGED FROM THE YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS.

A GLOOMY OUTLOOK FOR LIBRARIES?.

PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS HALTED AT A POINT WHEN, BECAUSE OF THE
RECESSION, LIBRARY SERVICES ARE PARTICULARLY NECESSARY. CURRENT ECONOMIC
MEASURES HAVE HIT LIBRARIES HARD. SOME PEOPLE NOW REGARD INFORMATION AS
MERCHANDISE FOR WHICH A SUITABLE MARKET PRICE MUST BE OBTAINED; THIS INCREASES
THE RISK OF INFORMATION SERVICES BEING TAKEN OVER BY PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH
COULD LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN STATE BUDGETS. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THREATENS TO BYPASS THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND BECAUSE OF
THE COMPETITIVE SITUATION ON THE INFORMATION MARKET LIBRARIES ARE BEING ASKED
TO RESTRICT THEMSELVES TO THEIR TRADITIONAL TASKS. LIBRARIES MUST MOBILISE
RESERVES HITHERTO UNUSED; REFUSING TO IMPLEMENT NEW METHODS OF LITERATURE
PROVISION COULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. INITIAL ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS
CAN BE OVERCOME THROUGH RATIONALISATION, CENTRALISATION AND WIDER USE OF
ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING.

THE LIBRARY UNION IN HAMBURG.

IN 1978 A COOPERATIVE SCHEME WAS INAUGURATED BETWEEN THE COMBINED STATE AND
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND OVER 100 INSTITUTE AND DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES OF THE
COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE A UNION CATALOGUE AND ORGANISE COOPERATIVE
PURCHASING OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS. THE SCHEME HAS ALSO BEEN JOINED BY THE

REGIONAL COOPERATION' SOME PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS.

PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING OF THE WORKING PARTY ON PROVINCIAL CENTRAL
LIBRARIES IN DEVENTER, 19 NOV 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS THE CUTBACKS IN LOCAL
GOVERNMENT FINANCES TOGETHER WITH THE GROWING DEMAND ON LIBRARIES FOR
TECHNICAL INFORMATION HAVE ENCOURAGED PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO COOPERATE WITH ONE
ANOTHER ON A REGIONAL BASIS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THEIR
SERVICES. IN ADDITION THE EXPECTATION THAT THE EXISTING NETWORK OF LIBRARIES
CHARGED WITH A REGIONAL SUPPORT FUNCTION WILL BE INCREASED, AND THE
DECENTRALISATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES AS PROPOSED IN THE NEW PUBLIC
SERVICES ACT, WILL FURTHER ENCOURAGE THIS TREND. HOWEVER, WHERE LIBRARIES
ENTER INTO SCHEMES OF COOPERATION THE NEEDS OF THEIR READERS SHOULD REMAIN THE
PRIME CONSIDERATION.

LIBRARIES AND BUILDINGS. INTERRELATIONSHIPS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE HEIDELBERG
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

THE GROWTH OF LIBRARIES IN THIS CENTURY HAS LED TO REGULAR REBUILDING AND
REHOUSING OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE AT THE
HEIDELBERG UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THE LIBRARY WAS BUILT IN 1905 AND IS STILL
HOUSED IN THE ORIGINAL BUILDING WHICH IS NOW PROTECTED AS A LISTED BUILDING.
IN THE 1950S SOME INTERIOR STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE THE
GENERAL EFFICIENCY OF THE LIBRARY. FROM 1959 TO 1978 VARIOUS PLANS WERE MADE
FOR NEW UNIVERSITY LIBRARY BUILDINGS. THESE INCLUDED AN EXTENSION TO THE
LIBRARY IN PART OF THE OLD TOWN OF HEIDELBERG, A NEW BUILDING ON A NEW SITE TO
SERVE THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC FACULTIES AND SMALL EXTENSIONS FOR EXTRA
STORAGE. FINALLY DUE TO PLANNING RESTRICTIONS IN THE OLD TOWN AND THE 1966/67
RECESSION THE LIBRARY REMAINED AS IT WAS WITH TEMPORARY USE OF A MEDICAL
INSTITUTE BUILDING WHICH INVOLVES TRANSPORT PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE 2 SITES.

LITERARY HERITAGE IN LIBRARIES OF VARIOUS SIZES, A LIST HAS BEEN PUBLISHED OF
RECOMMENDED STOCKS, ACCORDING TO LIBRARY SIZE, FROM THE MAIN WORKS OF 43
GERMAN WRITERS AND POETS FROM 1750 TO 1848. ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD CHECK
THEIR STOCKS AND TRANSFER MATERIAL TO PLACES WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED. TO

LISTS OF NEW ACQUISITIONS' A CONTRIBUTION TO LIBRARY PUBLICITY.

IN JUNE 78 131 ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WERE ASKED WHETHER THEY ISSUED LISTS OF NEW
ACQUISITIONS; THE 116 REPLIES RECEIVED SHOWED THAT 49 DID ISSUE SUCH LISTS AND
67 DID NOT. SUITABLE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO EACH GROUP; DETAILED ANALYSIS
IS GIVEN OF THEIR ANSWERS ON AIMS BEHIND LIST ISSUE, LIST STRUCTURE, TARGET
GROUPS, PRODUCTION FORMS, COSTS, ADVERTISING, POSSIBILITIES OF USE CONTROL,
ALTERATION PROCESSES, CRITICISM AGAINST LISTS AND POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO
THEM. PRODUCTION OF THESE LISTS IS EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING; EACH LIBRARY
MUST DECIDE FOR ITSELF WHETHER IT IS WORTH PRODUCING THEM. IF BETTER USE IS TO
BE MADE OF THE LISTS, MORE ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THE SELECTION OF MATERIAL
AND TARGET GROUPS. IN FUTURE, SPECIFIC SUBJECT LISTS INCLUDING NON-COMMERCIAL
WORKS WILL PREDOMINATE OVER LISTS OF GENERAL MATERIAL AND ELECTRONIC DATA

ON THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION FOR THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IN A FACTORY
COMBINE.

MICROELECTRONICS HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE OVER MOST CONTEMPORARY INDUSTRIAL
WORKING PROCESSES, INCLUDING NOT ONLY THE FLOW OF MATERIAL, ENERGY AND
INFORMATION BUT ALSO GENERAL ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT. THUS IT IS CLEAR
THAT THE STAFF OF SPECIALIST RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS HAVE A GREATER NEED THAN
EVER BEFORE OF A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF INFORMATION. EXAMPLES OF THIS NEED AND
SUGGESTIONS FOR ITS RATIONAL SATISFACTION ARE PRESENTED WITH REFERENCE TO
EXPERIENCES IN A STRIP STEEL FACTORY CONCERNING THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IN
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS, STATISTICS
AND MANAGEMENT. THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY; ITS
POTENTIAL IN LARGE SCALE INFORMATION STORAGE AND DISSEMINATION IS NOT YET
FULLY EXPLOITED.

SINCE INDEPENDENCE, GHANA'S BOOK INDUSTRY HAS RECEIVED A GREAT DEAL OF
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE STATE TO DEVELOP A VIABLE MODERN INDIGENOUS
INFRASTRUCTURE. ITS PROGRESS HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY DETERIORATING ECONOMIC AND
OTHER FACTORS. LOW LITERACY IS SLOWING DOWN THE SPREAD OF THE BOOK CULTURE,

THE NEED FOR IMPROVED WORLDWIDE PROVISION OF PUBLICATIONS.

NATIONAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED BY INTERNATIONAL
AVAILABILITY. THE BEST EVIDENCE FOR THE NEED FOR BETTER INTERNATIONAL
PROVISION IS SUPPLIED BY DATA ON INTERNATIONAL LENDING. THE VOLUME OF
INTERNATIONAL LENDING AND PHOTOCOPYING IS ABOUT 1 MILLION ITEMS A YEAR AND IS
GROWING RAPIDLY. SATISFACTION RATES AND SUPPLY TIMES BOTH NEED IMPROVEMENT.
ABOUT 2/3 OF DEMAND IS FOR JOURNALS, AND IS CONCENTRATED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF
CENTRES, WHICH GIVE A MUCH BETTER THAN AVERAGE SERVICE. SPEED OF SUPPLY
APPEARS TO BE UNRELATED TO DISTANCE. POSSIBLE PATTERNS OF PROVISION FOR THE
FUTURE INCLUDE ACCESS TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL IMPRINTS, REGIONAL
SYSTEMS, AND LARGE NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY CENTRES IN COUNTRIES WITH HEAVY
INTERLENDING DEMAND.

THE INTERLIBRARY LOANS SYSTEM IN FINLAND.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 4TH FINNISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF INTERLIBRARY
LOANS IN THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION SERVICES TO SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY, HELD
23-24 APR 79. INTERLIBRARY LENDING SYSTEM IN FINLAND COMPRISES A NETWORK OF

PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORKING: NEAT, PLAUSIBLE, AND WRONG.

ARGUES THAT DEVELOPING NETWORKS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE USA IS NOT THE
ANSWER TO PROBLEMS OF LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES. USERS PREFER TO TAKE A 2ND
CHOICE WHICH IS AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY FROM THE SHELVES TO A 1ST CHOICE WHICH
HAS TO BE OBTAINED FROM ELSEWHERE AND THE 1ST THING TO BE CUT AS FUNDING FALLS
IS RESOURCE SHARING ACTIVITIES. PRESENTS STATISTICS FOR INTERLOANS IN
CALIFORNIA AND ILLINOIS TO SHOW WHAT A MINUTE % OF CIRCULATION IS ACCOUNTED

DETERMINATION OF THE CONSERVATION TIME OF PERIODICALS FOR OPTIMAL SHELF
MAINTENANCE OF A LIBRARY.

A METHOD BASED ON A CONSTRAINED OPTIMISATION TECHNIQUE IS PRESENTED TO
DETERMINE THE TIME OF REMOVAL OF SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS FROM THE SHELF OF A
LIBRARY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MINIMISING SHELF MAINTENANCE COST ON THE
CONDITION THAT THE LOSS OF THE INFORMATION IS LESS THAN SOME SPECIFIED RATE.
THE SOLUTION OBTAINED INDICATES THAT ALL THE UTILITIES OF THE PERIODICALS
SHOULD BE EQUAL AT THE REMOVAL TIME. A GEOMETRICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE
THEORETICAL RESULT IS GIVEN. A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE IS GIVEN TO SHOW HOW THIS
TECHNIQUE IS APPLICABLE TO REAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA.

THEFT AND DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS' THE LEGAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR
DEALING WITH THEFT FROM THE COLLECTIONS AND DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.

EACH YEAR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL IS WRITTEN OFF BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES
AS A RESULT OF THEFT OR DAMAGE BY LIBRARY USERS. IN THE MAASTRICHT PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS A STUDY OF THE PROBLEM MADE FROM JAN-JUNE 81 SHOWED
THAT SOME MATERIAL WAS REMOVED FROM THE LIBRARY WITHOUT REGISTERING THE
TRANSACTION, SOME WAS BORROWED ON TICKETS CONTAINING FALSE OR INCORRECT
INFORMATION, WHILE OTHERS WERE BORROWED AND NOT RETURNED, OR RETURNED IN A
DAMAGED CONDITION. WHERE PROOF OF THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY PROPERTY
EXISTS THE DUTCH CIVIL CODE ALLOWS LIBRARY AUTHORITIES TO INSTRUCT THE LOCAL
CHIEF INSPECTOR OF JUSTICE TO TAKE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE GUILTY PARTY.
WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS FOUND GUILTY THE JUDGE MAY ORDER COMPENSATION TO BE

BOOK THEFTS FROM UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AS A LEGAL PROBLEM.

THE THEFT OF BOOKS FROM LARGE, OPEN-PLAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IS A MANY-SIDED
PROBLEM. IT HAS REACHED SUCH PROPORTIONS THAT IT IS COSTING UNIVERSITIES IN
WEST GERMANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DM EVERY YEAR AND SPECIAL DETECTOR SYSTEMS
HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN SOME LIBRARIES. THESE HAVE LED TO MANY WOULD-BE THEFTS
BEING PREVENTED AND CHARGES BEING BROUGHT FOR THEFT. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF
THESE CHARGES HAVE HAD TO BE DROPPED OWING TO LOOPHOLES IN LAWS APPLICABLE TO
BOOK THEFTS. GERMAN CRIMINAL LAW STIPULATES THAT THE INTENTION OF KEEPING AN
OBJECT MUST BE PRESENT TO CONSTITUTE A THEFT; THIS IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
PROVE IN THE CASE OF BOOK THEFTS. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ALSO FAILS TO
PROVIDE ADEQUATE PENALTIES AND VARIES FROM ONE STATE TO THE NEXT. IT IS
NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE THEFT OF BOOKS AS AN OFFENCE IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW,
PUNISHABLE BY A FINE THROUGHOUT WEST GERMANY.

CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP-ITS ROLE IN LIBRARY CATALOGUING.

AN EXPLORATION OF PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY JUSTIFICATION
FOR THE TREATMENT OF CORPORATE BODIES AS AUTHORS REVEALS A HISTORY OF PARTIAL
ANSWERS AND INSUFFICIENTLY DETAILED ANALYSES BOTH OF CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP IN
PARTICULAR AND OF AUTHORSHIP IN GENERAL. THE REASON FOR THE FAILURES PROBABLY
RESTS IN THE FACT THAT AUTHORSHIP IS BOTH A COMPLEX PHENOMENON AND NECESSARILY
SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LIBRARY CATALOGUE THAT IT
IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED. PART I DEALS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF
CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP AND PART II WITH THE NATURE OF AUTHORSHIP IN GENERAL
UNDER THE HEADINGS' AUTHORSHIP BY ORIGINATION, AUTHORSHIP BY ASSUMPTION OF
RESPONSIBILITY, CORPORATE UTTERANCES AND CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP. IN CONCLUSION
RELATES CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP TO LIBRARY CATALOGUING.

STANDARDS ARE A PRE-REQUISITE TO SHARING DATA-A STANDARD DEFINITION OF A
SERIAL, THE ISSN, THE MARC FORMAT, STANDARDS FOR HOLDINGS STATEMENTS AND
LIBRARY SYMBOLS AND CATALOGUING STANDARDS. USE OF STANDARD SOURCES OF DATA
ALSO FACILITATES SHARING. A NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE NOW EXISTS IN CANADA ON

ON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE IS LIKELY TO CONSIST OF COMPONENTS DEVELOPED
INDEPENDENTLY BY INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES OR GROUPS OF LIBRARIES WHICH HAVE
VOLUNTARILY ADOPTED GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS SUGGESTED BY THE CACC. THE ROLE
OF THE CACC IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF EXISTING AND EMERGING CATALOGUES WHICH
MIGHT BECOME COMPONENTS, THE PROMOTION OF ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THOSE COMPONENTS

THE USE OF 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS AS A PRINCIPLE ELEMENT IN CATCHWORD CATALOGUES
IS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. THE TERM 'NARROW' IS TOO VAGUE AND DOES NOT CONVEY
THE CONTENT AND MEANING WHICH IT SHOULD. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS DEFINING A CLASSIFICATION METHOD; THIS
IS HOWEVER, NOT THE CASE. LIBRARIES WOULD BE ADVISED TO CONFORM WITH STANDARD
TERMINOLOGY USED IN DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TO AVOID FURTHER
USE OF THE 'NARROW' CATCHWORD OR 'NARROW' TERM. THE CONTROL OF CLASSIFICATION
TERMINOLOGY IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH SHOULD BE MORE
CLEARLY DEFINED. EXAMINING SUCH TERMS AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'

LACK OF STANDARDIZATION OF THE JOURNAL TITLE DATA ELEMENT IN DATABASES.

THE PROBLEM OF DATA ELEMENT REPRESENTATION IS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN MOST
PERCEIVE. THE NUMBER OF STANDARDS (INTERNAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL) IS
LARGE, BUT THE USE OF STANDARDS IN DATA BASES IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THE RESULT IS
A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF STANDARDISATION BOTH WITHIN AND ACROSS DATA BASES. THE
RESULT BECOMES APPARENT WHEN ONE ATTEMPTS AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH ON A PARTICULAR
DATA ELEMENT IN MULTIPLE DATA BASES. THE JOURNAL TITLE ELEMENT WAS STUDIED IN
8 DATA BASES, AND 4 MEASURES WERE DEVELOPED TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF
STANDARDISATION WITHIN A DATA BASE AND SOME OF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR SEARCHING.

ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE LITERATURE RESEARCH AND THE EXISTING AVAILABLE DATA
BASES.

OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE LITERATURE RESEARCH COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL
METHODS SUCH AS LIBRARY SUBJECT CATALOGUES ARE' THE RESEARCH RESULTS ARE
COMPLETE; THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS PRECISE DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF
AND/OR COMBINATIONS; TIME IS SAVED AND THE RESEARCH RESULTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY
PRINTED IN A HARDCOPY FORM INSTEAD OF HAVING TO BE PHOTOCOPIED OR HANDWRITTEN.
IN WEST GERMANY, 75% OF COMPUTER STORED LITERATURE REFERENCES I.E. 70 MILLION
DOCUMENT UNITS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES. 3
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DATA BASES IN WEST GERMANY ARE DIMDI (DEUTSCHES INSTITUT
FUR MEDIZINISCHE DOKUMENTATION UND INFORMATION, INKA (INFORMATIONSSYSTEM
KARLSRUHE) AND GID (GESELLSCHAFT FUR INFORMATION UND DOKUMENTATION). THE

INVESTIGATION WAS MADE INTO PRICE CHANGES DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS FOR 157
CURRENT NATURAL SCIENCE PERIODICALS HELD BY THE UNIVERSITY OF ULM. WHILE IN
THE PERIOD 1976-80 AN AVERAGE PRICE INCREASE OF 5% WAS RECORDED, AFTER
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS THE INCREASE RATE FOR 1981 SEEMS TO BE MUCH HIGHER

CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN ENGLISH' A SELECT, ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY, 1835-1935.

SINCE THE 1950S THE STUDY OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED INTO AN
AUTONOMOUS ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE. RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND INFORMATION CENTRES AS
WELL AS SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE FIELD HAVE PROLIFERATED. SEVERAL
SCHOLARLY PERIODICALS ARE DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. CURRENT
ACADEMIC INTEREST IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE GROWING
NUMBER OF DISSERTATIONS AND THESES FOR ADVANCED DEGREES. THIS TENDENCY IS ALSO
DISCERNABLE IN SOUTH AFRICA. AN INFORMATION CENTRE FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE
AND MEDIA (ISKEMUS) WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF STELLENBOSCH IN 1978.
POTCHEFSTROOM HAS AN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE WHICH HAS
ALREADY HELD 2 COUNTRY-WIDE SYMPOSIA AND HAS HAD A BOOK PUBLISHED UNDER ITS
AUSPICES BY TAFELBERG. ACADEMIC STUDY OF THE GENRE NECESSITATES THE FORMATION
OF COLLECTIONS OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS AND MEDIA REFLECTING THE PERSONAL BIAS AN D
INTEREST OF THE RESEARCHERS. SUCH COLLECTION BUILDING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT BECAUSE INVESTORS REGARD FINE CHILDREN'S BOOKS AS SOUND FINANCIAL
INVESTMENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR SCARCITY. AT STELLENBOSCH A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF
ABOUT 1,000 BOOKS REFLECTS THE CULTURAL INFLUENCE OF MAINLY VICTORIAN ENGLISH
MIDDLE-CLASS JUVENILE READING MATTER, 1830-1930. A VERY BRIEF INDICATION OF
SOME OF THE INTERESTING ITEMS IS REFLECTED IN THE SELECT, ANNOTATED ABSTRACT

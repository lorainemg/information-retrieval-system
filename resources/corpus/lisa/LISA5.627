PROVIDING A MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE TO ETHNIC MINORITIES.

A MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE IS ONLY LIKELY TO HAVE TO CATER FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES
IN URBAN AREAS. AFTER THE LOCAL ETHNIC MINORITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED A
REASONABLE STOCK OF BOOKS IN THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGES MUST BE INCLUDED
BEARING IN MIND THAT SEVERAL ETHNIC MINORITIES ARE ENGLISH-SPEAKING E.G. WEST
INDIANS. STOCKS OF BOOKS FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES MUST PERFORCE BE LIMITED SINCE
ETHNIC MINORITIES ALSO READ BOOKS ORIGINATING FROM THE DOMINANT CULTURE' A
SURFEIT WOULD ALSO ALIENATE THE NON-ETHNIC MINORITY USERS. THE PROBLEM OF
STOCK SELECTION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE BOOKS CAN BE OVERCOME BY USING ETHNIC
MINORITY STAFF.

NON-USE AND LOSER STUDIES IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,
JULY 80. ARGUES THAT USE AND USER STUDIES HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED, OR
BEEN INFLUENTIAL IN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE DO NOT YET
HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY SHOULD BE INTERPRETED.
SUGGESTS THAT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELEVANT ASPECTS OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF THE

AND TO THE MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OF STUDIES OF COLLECTION USE AND USER
PATTERNS. DESCRIBES BRIEFLY AN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM FOR LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION

DESCRIBES THE DISCIPLINE OF BIBLIOMETRICS WITH REFERENCE TO A NORDINFO COURSE
ATTENDED IN HELSINKI. DEFINES BIBLIOMETRICS AS QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF
LIBRARY TECHNIQUES. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE USED ON A GLOBAL SCALE, BUT
THEY CAN ALSO BE A TOOL TO CALCULATE THE BEST USE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY'S
RESOURCES. AMONG THE EMPIRICAL LAWS DEVELOPED, BRADFORD'S LAW IS THE MOST
APPLICABLE. DESCRIBES THE USE OF THIS LAW TO OBTAIN A GRAPH WITH AN
EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING PART, A SO-CALLED BRADFORD GRAPH. THIS CAN SHOW THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUTHORS AND NUMBER OF ARTICLES, ARTICLES AND QUOTATIONS
AND CAN HELP TO DETERMINE THE PROCESS OF OBSOLESCENCE OF LITERATURE IN A

(CONSISTING OF AUTHOR CODES AND ARTICLE NUMBERS). THEN THE WEIBULL, NEGATIVE
BINOMIAL AND 2 FORMS OF THE LOTKA DISTRIBUTION ARE COMPARED WITH THE OBSERVED
DISTRIBUTIONS OF AUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY, USING THE CHI SQUARED AND

THE MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE' AN INTERDISCIPLINARY
CROSS-CITATION ANALYSIS.

A METHOD IS PROPOSED FOR MEASURING INTERDISCIPLINARY RELATIONS IN SCIENTIFIC
LITERATURE BASED ON CROSS CITATION AMONG CORE JOURNALS EMPIRICALLY SELECTED ON
THE BASIS OF USE AND IMPORTANCE. THE METHOD IS USED TO TEST HYPOTHESES DERIVED
FROM A BIBLIOMETRIC DEFINITION OF INTERDISCIPLINARITY AMONG THE MANAGEMENT AND
SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURES. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE MANAGEMENT LITERATURE
IS DEPENDENT ON THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, THAT IS MORE DEPENDENT ON THEM THAN VICE
VERSA, AND THAT IT IS MORE DEPENDENT ON THEM THAN THEY ARE ON EACH OTHER.

A REPORT OF THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF A SPANISH STATE SPONSORED RESEARCH
PROJECT. THE ANALYSIS COVERS CITATIONS OF PAPERS ON ANTINEOPLASTIC SUBSTANCES
IN 2CANCER RESEARCH1 FROM 1976-79. A TOTAL OF 7,815 REFERENCES TO 576
PERIODICALS CARRIED IN 284 PAPERS WAS OBTAINED, AND THE BRADFORD TECHNIQUE
APPLIED TO ASCERTAIN THE CORE PERIODICALS RECEIVING AN AVERAGE OF 1 CITATION
PER MONTH. A COMPARISON WAS THEN MADE BETWEEN CORE AND NON-CORE PERIODICAL
THEMATIC COVERAGE OF 8 ANTINEOPLASTIC SUBSTANCES; AND THE QUANTITATIVE

REGIONAL COLLABORATION IN THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SYSTEM.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
SWEDEN'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE BASICALLY OPERATED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE
STATE CAN PROVIDE GRANTS TO LEVEL OUT STANDARDS BUT DOES NOT INTERFERE IN THE
RUNNING OF LOCAL LIBRARIES, AND SWEDEN HAS NO LIBRARIES ACT. MUNICIPAL
AUTHORITIES THEMSELVES DECIDE THE OBJECTIVES, SCALE AND STRUCTURE OF THEIR
LIBRARY SERVICES. ALL OF SWEDEN'S 279 MUNICIPALITIES PROVIDE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY
SERVICES. CERTAIN LIBRARY FUNCTIONS WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE ON A
PURELY MUNICIPAL BASIS-IT IS THEREFORE RATIONAL AND EFFICIENT TO TRANSFER
THESE TO THE REGIONAL OR SUPRAMUNICIPAL-THAT IS, COUNTY-LEVEL.

NETWORKS.

REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING ON REGIONAL LIBRARY
COOPERATION IN DEVENTER, 19 NOV 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS COOPERATION AMONGST
LIBRARIES OF ALL TYPES HAS COME UNDER CLOSE EXAMINATION AS A RESULT OF THE
INCLUSION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE PROPOSED PUBLIC SERVICES ACT. THE
CONCEPT OF LIBRARY NETWORKS DATES FROM THE EARLY 1900S WHEN THE NEED FOR
LIBRARIES TO SHARE THEIR RESOURCES WAS RECOGNISED. THE MOST EFFECTIVE LIBRARY
NETWORKS ARE THOSE NETWORKS WHICH OPERATE THEIR SERVICES ON A FINANCIAL BASIS.
IN ADDITION, THE COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION POLICIES, CATALOGUING SERVICES
AND INTERLIBRARY LENDING AMONGST MEMBERS OF A LIBRARY NETWORK REQUIRES THE
MOST UP-TO-DATE TELECOMMUNICATION AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. WITHIN EACH NETWORK
A CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE DESIGNATED TO ACT AS A CLEARING-HOUSE FOR THE

EXTRA-MURAL FUNCTIONS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

FOR OVER 10 YEARS PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN BUYING MORE ACADEMIC LITERATURE
THAN BEFORE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OFFERING THE USE OF THEIR FACILITIES TO
PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY. THIS EXTRA-MURAL WORK MUST NOT BE REDUCED
BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS; THE OBVIOUS NEED FOR ACADEMIC MATERIAL MUST BE
SATISFIED AND INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND PURCHASING SCHEMES MUST RESULT IN A
BETTER COORDINATED AND MORE ECONOMICAL USE OF LITERATURE. THE BUILDING UP OF
UNION CATALOGUES USING ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING AND OF DECENTRALISED
MICROFICHE AND SCREEN TEXT SERVICES WILL EASE THE DEMAND ON UNIVERSITY SPECIAL
COLLECTIONS. ISOLATION OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WILL NOT IMPROVE THEIR PUBLIC

AUTOMATION: A CHALLENGE TO THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF THE LIBRARY AND THE SOCIAL
CHARACTER OF THE STAFF?.

DISCUSSES THE IDEAS OF COBABUS AND THIEM ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
AUTOMATION AND' (1) PRODUCTIVITY; (2) PRODUCT QUALITY; (3) STAFF
QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING, AND THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ON
EXPENDITURE UPON THESE RELATIONSHIPS. AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES TENDS TO LAG
BEHIND AUTOMATION IN OTHER FIELDS BUT IT DEMANDS CHANGES IN STAFF TRAINING,
INTELLECTUALISATION OF PRODUCTION WORK AND A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC
AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. PROCESSES PREVIOUSLY SEPARATED CAN BE INTEGRATED BY
AUTOMATION. BEFORE AUTOMATION THERE WAS A TENDENCY TOWARDS RIGIDITY IN THE
HIGHER STAFF GRADES; NOW AUTOMATION REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE STAFF HIERARCHY
AND THE OLD IDEA OF THE 'CLASSICAL LIBRARIAN'.

DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE WORK TO BE DONE AND ASSERTS THAT CERTAIN
TECHNICAL AIDS, SUCH AS THE TELEPHONE AND THE PHOTOCOPIER, ARE REGARDED AS
ESSENTIAL TO A LIBRARY'S SERVICES. IN SPITE OF UNEMPLOYMENT IT IS BECOMING
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN STAFF FOR CERTAIN TASKS IN

LIBRARIES AS MUNICIPAL INFORMATION CENTRES; THE DANISH EXPERIENCE.

TALK GIVEN TO THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING HELD IN STOCKHOLM AUG 80. THE
DANISH LOCAL AUTHORITY REFORMS OF 1970 AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY PLANNING ACT OF
1977, WHICH EXTENDED THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE, INTENSIFIED THE DEMAND FOR A
MORE EFFICIENT PUBLIC INFORMATION SERVICE. TO SATISFY THIS DEMAND THE STATE
INFORMATION OFFICE FOR DISTRIBUTION OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION WAS SET UP IN
1977 AND COOPERATION WITH LIBRARIES ESTABLISHED. THE REPORT ON 'LOCAL
PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY' STIMULATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC INFORMATION
SERVICES IN LIBRARIES. THE 'KOMMUNE-INFORMATION' AT THE TOWN LIBRARY OF
LYNGBY-TAARBAEK WAS SET UP IN 1977. IT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE REFERENCE ROOM
AND STAFFED BY 1 FULL-TIME LIBRARIAN. CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE TOWN HALL
EXISTS AND CONTACT PERSONS IN EACH DEPARTMENT WERE APPOINTED. ALL MATERIAL
AUTOMATICALLY SENT TO KOMMUNE-INFORMATION IS CATALOGUED AND DISPLAYED AND SOME
MAY BE BORROWED. AN INFORMATIO N INDEX OF LOCAL ITEMS IS BEING BUILT UP.
AROUND 400 ENQUIRIES A MONTH ARE DEALT WITH, SOME BY REFERENCE TO THE RELEVANT
DEPARTMENT, OTHERS DIRECTLY, CONCERNING' DECISIONS MADE, RIGHTS AND DUTIES,

SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE POSITION IN THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA.

(M.A. THESIS). THE INVESTIGATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY
INTERRELATEDNESS BETWEEN BOOK SELECTION AND CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
CARRIED OUT. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY CENSORSHIP IN UK,
USA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WAS FOLLOWED BY AN EXPLORATORY, EMPIRICAL
INVESTIGATION OF THE POSITION IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE SELECTION POLICIES OF THE 4

A STUDY OF THE INTERACTION IN BOOK SELECTION BETWEEN PROVINCIAL LIBRARY
SYSTEMS AND THEIR AFFILIATED PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN SOUTH AFRICA.

(M.A. THESIS). EXAMINED CURRENT METHODS OF BOOK SELECTION IN RURAL, PROVINCIAL
LIBRARIES, IN SOUTH AFRICA, WITH A VIEW TO ESTABLISHING WHETHER THEY ARE THE
MOST EFFECTIVE POSSIBLE. RESULTS SHOWED THAT RELATIVELY LITTLE CHANGE HAD
TAKEN PLACE IN THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES OF THESE LIBRARIES AND THEIR BOOK
SELECTION METHODS SINCE THEIR INCEPTION AND THAT INVOLVEMENT OF LOCAL
LIBRARIANS IN BOOK SELECTION WAS NEGLIGIBLE. RURAL LIBRARIES IN COUNTRIES
OUTSIDE SOUTH AFRICA WERE REVIEWED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A MODEL AGAINST WHICH TO
MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF SOUTH AFRICAN LIBRARIES.

LITERATURE SELECTION AND ACQUISITION.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE,
REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. AT REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY A CENTRAL ACQUISITIONS
DEPARTMENT COORDINATES ORDERS RECEIVED FROM THE CENTRAL AND SUBJECT LIBRARIES
AND CONTROLS ALL PRE-ACCESSION WORK, FINANCE AND BUDGETING. A BALANCE OF
CENTRALISED AND DECENTRALISED TASKS PROVES SUCCESSFUL. THE CENTRAL
ACQUISITIONS DEPARTMENT FINDS INFORMATION ON DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LITERATURE
AND SENDS THIS TO THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS. LITERATURE SELECTION IS MADE JOINTLY
BY THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS AND THE FACULTIES. THE SUBJECT LIBRARIAN TRACES
MISSING BIBLIOGRAPHIC DETAILS FOR THE ACQUISITIONS DEPARTMENT. GERMAN LANGUAGE
MATERIAL IS BOUGHT FROM LOCAL BOOK-SELLERS, FOREIGN MATERIAL FROM A VARIETY OF
SOURCES; GIFTS, EXCHANGES AND DEPOSIT COPIES ALSO PROVIDE USEFUL MATERIAL.
PERIODICALS ARE OBTAINED MAINLY THROUGH DIRECT ORDERING.

THE LIBRARY SERVICE'S REVIEWS AND LIBRARIES' BOOK PURCHASES.

FACED WITH CUTS IN BOOK BUDGETS, LIBRARIANS HAVE TO CHOOSE TO WHICH GROUPS OF
USERS THEY SHOULD GIVE PRIORITY' THOSE WHO USE THE LIBRARY MOST, I.E. THOSE
WITH HIGHER EDUCATION, OR THE MINORITY FOR WHOM THE NEED FOR MEANINGFUL
ACTIVITIES BEYOND TV AND WEEKLY MAGAZINES IN A TIME OF UNEMPLOYMENT IS GREAT.
FEARS THAT CUTS ARE MADE, NOT IN THE PULP ENTERTAINMENT LITERATURE BUT IN
BOOKS BY QUALITY AUTHORS. INSTEAD OF DEFENDING WHAT IS CULTURALLY VALUABLE,
LIBRARIANS GIVE IN TO POPULAR DEMAND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIGH LOAN FIGURES.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LIBRARY SERVICE'S REVIEWS AND LIBRARY PURCHASES
DEMONSTRATES THIS' WELL REVIEWED QUALITY BOOKS ARE BOUGHT IN SMALL NUMBERS,
WHEREAS MULTIPLE COPIES ARE BOUGHT OF ENTERTAINMENT LITERATURE, DESPITE
LUKEWARM REVIEWS.

MODELING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT BEHAVIOUR' A PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.

DESCRIBES A MODEL FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WITHIN BOTH
SPECIFIC COLLECTIONS AND LIBRARY SYSTEMS AS A WHOLE AND SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE
THE FULL RANGE AND COMPLEXITY OF RELEVANT FACTORS. ALTHOUGH THE MODEL
PRESENTED IS NOT NOW QUANTIFIABLE IN ALL ITS DIMENSIONS, ITS ANALYSIS IS SEEN
AS LEADING TOWARDS BETTER MODELS FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IN TURN
WILL ALLOW MORE USEFUL PLANS AND PROJECTIONS.

SELECTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL MATERIALS AND ACQUISITION POLICY' GENERAL
PROBLEMS.

DISCUSSES THE SITUATION IN LATIN AMERICA'S UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. EXAMINES THE STATE OF EDUCATION
IN GENERAL, WHERE HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED USUALLY AT THE EXPENSE
OF THE ELEMENTARY STAGES; LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS BENEFITED ACCORDINGLY, BUT
ALTHOUGH SOME UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ARE ADEQUATELY RESOURCED, RATIONALISATION
AND PLANNING OF FUTURE POLICIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAXIMISE USE OF RESOURCES.
HENCE LIBRARIANS SHOULD DEVELOP DEFINITE SELECTION AND ACQUISITION POLICIES
USING THE ADVICE OF SPECIALISTS, AND DISREGARDING RESTRICTIONS OF RESOURCES BY
AUTHORITIES UNAPPRECIATIVE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES IN PROMOTING CULTURE
AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE.

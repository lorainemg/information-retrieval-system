(MLS THESIS.) EXAMINES CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING NATIONAL LIBRARY
SERVICES, INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS, AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN AFRICA,
ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN, CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN REGION, AGAINST THE
BACKGROUND OF DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN ZAMBIA. THE ZAMBIAN DEVELOPMENTS ARE SHOWN
TO BE INADEQUATE AND TOO UNCOORDINATED AND THE COUNTRY'S PRESENT LIBRARY
SERVICES ARE CLAIMED NOT TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ORIENTED TOWARDS MEETING NATIONAL
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASPIRATIONS. A NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE IS DESIGNED WHICH
WILL (1) MEET ZAMBIA'S SPECIFIC NEEDS AND (2) CO-EXIST SMOOTHLY WITH NATIONAL

HOW CAN WE USE LIBRARY RESEARCH?.

INTRODUCTIONS TO A DEBATE HELD AT THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING IN STOCKHOLM
AUG 80. O. HARBO DISTINGUISHES 4 TYPES OF LIBRARY RESEARCH AND THEIR USES. THE
MOST IMPORTANT IS RESEARCH IN THE LIBRARY PROFESSIONAL AREA, I.E. RESEARCH
INTO ACQUISITION, STORING AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. THE RESULTS CAN BE
USED DIRECTLY, OR INDIRECTLY FOR THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT OF THE PERSON
CARRYING OUT THE RESEARCH. MANY LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CAN ONLY BE CARRIED
OUT BY CENTRAL LIBRARY BODIES. M. OKKO POINTS TO THE DANGERS OF LIBRARY
RESEARCH WHICH IS CARRIED OUT FOR ITS USEFULNESS ONLY AND IIS DIRECTED BY
OUTSIDE INTERESTS. THE THEORETICAL RESULTS OF BASIC LIBRARY SCIENCE MUST
PERMEATE THE PROFESSIONAL THINKING AND PRACTICE. B. QUENTZER DETECTS A
MISTRUST OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING IN LIBRARIES. EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP MUST
BE CHANGED SO THAT IT IS MORE PROBLEM ORIENTATED AND CRITICAL, THUS AN
INTEREST IN LIBRARY RESEARCH CAN BE BUILT UP. INCLUDES CONTRIBUTIONS TO  THE
DEBATE BY G. RENBORG AND E. STARFELT.

THE PROGRAMME FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH COMPLETED.

THE LIBRARY HIGH SCHOOL'S WORKING PARTY ON LIBRARY RESEARCH HAS NOW COMPLETED
ITS WORK AND DRAWN UP A PROGRAMME. THE BACKGROUND TO THE WORK WAS THE REFORM
OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN 1977, WHICH ENCOURAGED RESEARCH, GIVING PRIORITY TO'
DEVELOPMENT OF FOUNDATION COURSES WHICH ENCOURAGE THE STUDENTS TO MAKE USE OF
NEW RESEARCH RESULTS, FURTHER TRAINING OF LECTURERS, AND IMPROVEMENT OF
FACILITIES FOR LECTURERS TO FOLLOW CURRENT RESEARCH. THE WORKING PARTY AT ITS
1ST MEETING IN AUG 78 ADOPTED THESE GUIDELINES' TO EXAMINE EXISTING
EDUCATIONAL PLANS TO SEE HOW FAR THEY PROMOTE STUDENT USE OF LIBRARY RESEARCH;
TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; TO PROMOTE RESEARCH SKILLS
AMONG TEACHERS OF LIBRARIANSHIP; TO INITIATE RESEARCH PROJECTS. A PERMANENT
SEMINAR FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH WAS SET UP IN 1978 AND PARTICIPANTS WERE SENT ON
COURSES AND CONFERENCES. AN EXAMINATION OF ON-GOING LIBRARY-RELEVANT RESEARCH
IN SWEDISH SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS WAS MADE  AND TO FACILITATE THE MONITORING
OF THIS RESEARCH A COMPUTER BASED INDEX' NORDIC BDI INDEX, HAS BEEN CREATED.

FOLLOWING' NORTHEASTERN OHIO WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE 40% OF THE PROFESSIONAL
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE THROUGH 1990; A NEW GRADUATE SCHOOL WILL
NOT BE WARRANTED IN THE 1980S BECAUSE OF THE TIGHT JOB MARKET; AND TRANSFER OF

SOCIALIST LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE GDR.

SUMMARY OF A THESIS PRESENTED TO THE SITTARD SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
STUDIES IN 1980. EAST GERMANY HAS A HIGHLY DEVELOPED NETWORK OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. IN EACH OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 REGIONS CENTRAL LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN
DESIGNATED TO ACT AS REGIONAL SUPPORT CENTRES FOR THE SMALLER DISTRICT AND
LOCAL COMMUNITY LIBRARIES. LIBRARY SERVICES ARE GOVERNED BY THE STATE LIBRARY
ACT OF 1968 AND ALL LIBRARIES ARE MEMBERS OF THE EAST GERMAN UNION OF
LIBRARIES. IN CONTRAST TO LIBRARIES IN WESTERN EUROPE LIBRARIES IN EAST
GERMANY HAVE A STRONG POLITICAL CHARACTER AND ARE COMPELLED BY LAW TO SUPPORT

SELLING TO SURVIVE.

EDITED AND ABRIDGED VERSION OF A TALK GIVEN AT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S
BRANCH AND MOBILE LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, LYTHAM ST. ANNES, OCT-NOV
80. ALTHOUGH INCOME-GENERATING INNOVATIONS WILL HELP THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE
SHORT TERM, THE RESULTANT REVENUE WILL ALWAYS BE A RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION
OF THE BUDGET AND SUCH ACTIVITIES COULD PREJUDICE THE LIBRARY'S LONG TERM
SURVIVAL BY GIVING THE PUBLIC THE WRONG IMPRESSION. ONLY A MORE BUSINESS-LIKE,
PLANNED, BALANCED APPROACH THAN PREVIOUSLY PRACTISED CAN SAVE THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY. MARKETING CAN OFFER SUCH AN APPROACH. THE LIBRARY SHOULD TAILOR
SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS COMMUNITY, TRAIN ITS STAFF TO BE
SALESPEOPLE, AND WORK ON PERSONAL COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC.

INFORMATION THEORY SHOWS THAT HIS NEW FUNCTION IS APPLIED TO ONLY 2.3% OF THE

BRADFORD'S ORIGINAL SIMPLE FORMULATION NOT ONLY FITS THIS SEGMENT BUT ALSO THE

LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IN MEETING INFORMATION CONSUMER'S NEEDS.

PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS
OF MEETING CITIZENS' INFORMATION NEEDS. RESIDENTS FROM 2,400 RANDOMLY-SELECTED
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES OF THE USA PARTICIPATED IN 15-MINUTE
TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS, JULY-OCT 79. IT APPEARS THAT THEY INFREQUENTLY CONSULT
LIBRARIES AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE IN WORK OR NON-WORK SITUATIONS. OF THE
17% USING LIBRARIES, THE MAJORITY (11%) DO NOT HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THE
LIBRARY AS AN INFORMATION PROVIDER. TO BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE COMPETITORS WITH
OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDERS, LIBRARIES MUST PUBLICISE RESOURCES AND SERVICES
MORE EFFECTIVELY, IMPROVE DOCUMENT DELIVERY CAPABILITY, AND IDENTIFY AND
REDUCE BARRIERS ENCOUNTERED BY THE CITIZEN WHEN ATTEMPTING TO GAIN ACCESS TO

PROCESS FOR THE PLACEMENT AND RENEWAL OF SCHOLARLY PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF FUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE US ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES DURING 1969-78. THROUGH MOST OF THE DECADE, THE LIBRARIES RELIED ON
A SERIES OF STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO MINIMISE OR HIDE THEIR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,
SHIFTING FROM MONOGRAPHIC TO SERIALS EXPENDITURE AND ELIMINATING DUPLICATES.
ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE THEY BEEN FORCED TO TURN TO CONSORTIA AND
NETWORKS TO ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURES ON THEM. THE LIBRARIES MUST FACE THEIR
PROBLEMS SQUARELY IN THE 1980S AND PRODUCE LEADERS WITH THE ASTUTENESS,
COURAGE, AND PERSUASIVENESS TO MAKE FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS UNDERSTAND THE
PROBLEMS. ONLY THEN, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCORD, WILL

MANAGERIAL RATING' A LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS MODEL.

IN NOV 71, AN AD-HOC COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
WAS ASKED TO DETERMINE IF EFFECTIVENESS MEASURES COULD BE APPLIED TO REFERENCE
ACTIVITIES AND, IF SO, TO PROPOSE SOME METHOD FOR COLLECTING THE NECESSARY
DATA. SEVERAL EFFECTIVENESS MODELS WERE STUDIED AND DISCARDED. THE COMMITTEE
THEN TRIED THE MANAGERIAL RATING MODEL, WHEREBY MANAGERS MEET TO IDENTIFY
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, THEN RECONVENE AFTER A GIVEN TIME TO RATE THEIR LEVELS
OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. A TRIAL INDICATED THAT THIS MODEL WAS SUITABLE AND THE
COMMITTEE REPORTED ACCORDINGLY, BUT NO FULL TRIAL EVER TOOK PLACE AND THE
COMMITTEE WAS DISBANDED. SUGGESTS THAT THIS WAS DUE TO THE METHOD'S POSSIBLE
DISADVANTAGES AND A LACK OF INTEREST.

THE TYPES OF STATISTICS NEEDED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF A REFERENCE PROGRAMME
IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY WERE INVESTIGATED BY COLLECTING DATA ON VARIABLES SUCH
AS PEAK TIMES OF HEAVIST REFERENCE USE, TYPE OF REFERENCE QUESTIONS, TIME
SPENT IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS, TYPE OF EMPLOYEE ANSWERING QUESTIONS, ADEQUACY
OF RESPONSES, REASONS FOR INADEQUATE ANSWERS, AND WHETHER PROFESSIONAL STAFF
WERE ANSWERING THE MORE SOPHISTICATED QUESTIONS. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA
INDICATED THAT SUCH INFORMATION COULD BE USED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF AN
ACADEMIC LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICE AND THAT A STANDARDISED DATA FORM COULD BE
USED FOR BOTH GENERAL REFERENCE SERVICE AND REFERENCE SERVICE IN A SPECIALISED

LIBRARIANS ARE CONSTANTLY FACED WITH THE TASK OF SUPPLYING LITERATURE ON
RAPIDLY DEVELOPING SUBJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE. MECHANICAL
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS APT TO YIELD VAST AMOUNTS OF REFERENCES WHICH HAVE TO
BE WEEDED OUT. CRITERIA FOR THIS VARY, BUT ARE USUALLY DICTATED BY NECESSITY,
NAMELY THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS. THUS THE USER CAN READILY BE
SUPPLIED WITH THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN WELL KNOWN JOURNALS STOCKED BY THE
LIBRARY. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE USER GETS A GOOD COVERAGE INITIALLY,
OR WHETHER HE MUST INSIST ON TOTAL RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTS. THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE ACUTE IN THE FUTURE. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION
IS TO ANALYSE THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF PAPERS RELEVANT TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC IN

SERIALS DEPARTMENTS' DOOMED TO EXTINCTION?.

BECAUSE TASKS AND MATERIALS RELATED TO SERIALS PROCESSING AND USE ARE OFTEN
DISPERSED IN A LIBRARY, SERIALS SPECIALISTS MUST DEVELOP PERSONAL INFLUENCE
STRATEGIES AND USE INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WHICH CROSS ORGANISATIONAL
BOUNDARIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, SERIALS SPECIALISTS AND
INFORMAL SERIALS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. IT IS WIDELY
AGREED THAT INFORMAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS EMERGE SPONTANEOUSLY IN
ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH NO FORMALLY CONFERRED AUTHORITY MAY USE
VARIOUS TYPES OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE ORGANISATIONAL
OBJECTIVES. WHILE SERIALS PROCESSING AND PUBLIC SERVICE COULD BE MOST
EFFICIENTLY HANDLED THROUGH A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, INFORMAL COMMUNICATION
SYSTEMS, UTILISED BY SERIALS SPECIALISTS, WILL DEVELOP IF SUCH A DEPARTMENT
DOES NOT EXIST. IN DETERMINING IF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT HAS A PLACE IN A

BARCODING A COLLECTION-WHY, WHEN, AND HOW.

AS A SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARY, CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES'
APPROACH TO LIBRARY AUTOMATION WAS TO AIM FOR AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. IT WAS
DECIDED TO LABEL ALL ITEMS WITH MACHINE-READABLE IDENTIFIERS AND ENTER THE
UNIQUE IDENTIFIER INTO THE DATA BASE AT THE TIME EACH RECORD WAS CREATED. THE
RATIONALE FOR THESE DECISIONS IS DISCUSSED. DIFFERENT TYPES OF
MACHINE-READABLE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE REVIEWED. THE TYPE OF LABELS

ORIEL COMPUTER SERVICES-CIRCULATION SYSTEM.

ORIEL'S APPROACH TO THE DESIGN OF A CIRCULATION SYSTEM MATCHES ITS APPROACH TO
ITS OTHER LIBRARY AUTOMATION SERVICES. IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A MODULAR
FASHION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A PARTICULAR LIBRARY. THE APPROACH IS TO DISCUSS
WITH STAFF THE LIBRARY NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND FROM THESE TO DESIGN A
SYSTEM WHICH MEETS THOSE NEEDS AT MINIMUM COST. A CIRCULATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN
OPERATING SUCCESSFULLY IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY IN EUROPE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. THE
GENERAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, SYSTEM ELEMENTS, NETWORK, HARDWARE, SYSTEM

GEAC IN ACTION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HULL.

THE GEAC TERMINALS AT HULL UNIVERSITY ARE STANDARD, COMPRISING KEYBOARD, VDU
AND LIGHTPEN AND THE SYSTEM IS RUN ON A GEAC 8000 MINI. FILES ARE STORED ON
2X300 MEGABYTE DISCS. SINCE HULL HAD NO EXISTING MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGUE, A
FULL RECORD OF ALL STOCK HAD TO BE COMPILED. THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL
SYSTEM AT PRESENT OPERATES ONLY ON A SMALL SECTION OF THE STOCK, BUT IT IS
HOPED TO EXTEND THIS TO ALL CLASSES. ECONOMIC STRINGENCY OBLIGED HULL TO
DISCARD ITS FLEXIBLE AND EFFECTIVE MANUAL SYSTEM AND REPLACE IT WITH AN
EFFICIENT AND EASILY-USED SYSTEM. GEAC FULFILLED THE UNIVERSITY'S NEEDS, AND
THE PARTIAL SYSTEM OPERATING AT PRESENT MEETS HULL'S REQUIREMENTS.

AREAS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT; (3) DESIGN A SOLUTION; (4) DOCUMENT THE NEW
PROCEDURES; AND (5) IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION. THE PROCEDURES HIGHLIGHTED THE
FACT THAT MORE TIME WAS SPENT IN FINDING CATALOGUE COPY THAN IN ANY OTHER

IN JUNE 80, A NEW ZEALAND POST OFFICE OASIS TERMINAL (OVERSEAS ACCESS SERVICE
TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS) STARTED OPERATING IN THE COMMERCE, SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF AUCKLAND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. ITS ADVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY ARTICLES IN LOCAL PAPERS, PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, AND BASIC ON-LINE TRAINING
OF LIBRARY STAFF. DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE GAINED DURING THE 1ST 10 MONTHS OF
THE SERVICE AND DISCUSSES CHANGING PHILOSOPHIES WORLDWIDE. CONCLUDES THAT
ON-LINE SEARCHING IS COMING TO BE REGARDED AS AN EXTENSION OF TRADITIONAL
REFERENCE SERVICES; IT WILL NEVER BE SELF-FINANCING AND MUST BE PLANNED,
BUDGETED FOR, INTRODUCED AND DIRECTED LIKE ANY OTHER ASPECT OF LIBRARY WORK;
ITS SPEED HIGHLIGHTS THE PRESENT SLOWNESS OF DOCUMENT DELIVERY; AND IT IS A
NEW CHALLENGE TO THE LIBRARIAN'S PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE AND JUDGEMENT.

TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA' A NEW CHALLENGE FOR THE DESIGNER.

TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA DISPLAYS PRESENT A STRONG CHALLENGE TO THE INFORMATION
DESIGNER. THE MONOSPACED DOT MATRIX CHARACTERS ARE RELATIVELY CRUDE IN THEIR
DESIGN, AND THEIR POSITIONING IS DETERMINED BY A FIXED GRID. THE GRAPHICS
FACILITY IS ALSO SOMEWHAT CRUDE. THE SCOPE FOR TYPOGRAPHIC AND SPATIAL CODING
OF INFORMATION IS THEREFORE VERY LIMITED. THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE POSSIBILITY
OF USING COLOUR AS A WAY OF CODING INFORMATION. 7 COLOURS, INCLUDING WHITE,
ARE AVAILABLE, BUT THEY ARE NOT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AND THIS HAS IMPORTANT
IMPLICATIONS FOR LEGIBILITY. BEARING IN MIND THE CONSTRAINTS AND FREEDOM
OFFERED BY THIS KIND OF DISPLAY, WAYS OF PRESENTING TEXT, TABLES, INDEXES AND
GRAPHICS OF VARIOUS KINDS ARE DISCUSSED.

MEDICINE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY IMPLICATIONS FOR TRAINING AND CONTINUING
EDUCATION. SEARCHERS WERE SELECTED WITH FORMAL AND INFORMAL TRAINING, FROM 3
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANISATION, AND WITH DIFFERING LEVELS OF EXPERIENCE. IT
WAS FOUND THAT MOST SEARCHERS HAVE MASTERED THE BASICS OF SEARCHING, AND THAT
PERFORMANCE WAS UNAFFECTED BY SOURCE OF TRAINING, EXPERIENCE, ORGANISATIONAL,
OR EVEN SUBJECT EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND. THE MOST CONSISTENT SOURCE OF
DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SEARCH ITSELF. REPORT NOT

PROCESSING OF PATENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.

CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH CHEMICAL PATENT
INFORMATION SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1907. BY THE EARLY 1970S, ITS MANUAL DATA
PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR PATENTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF STRAIN WITH A MILLION
RECORDS ALREADY AND 200,000 BEING ADDED ANNUALLY. TO CONVERT TO A COMPUTERISED
SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE 25,000 MAN-HOURS IF EXISTING RECORDS WERE TO BE CONTAINED
IN THE NEW SYSTEM. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND IN 1977. AN
AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH INPADOC (THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION
CENTRE) FOR INPADOC TO DELIVER TO CAS A BACK-FILE OF 1.2 MILLION PATENT
RECORDS IN COMPUTER-READABLE FORM AND WEEKLY TAPES OF CURRENT PATENT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. DESCRIBES HOW CAS SELECTS PATENTS FROM THE TAPES

LIBRARY STOCK AS A SYSTEM OF PARTIAL BOOKSTOCKS.

IN A PARTICULAR LIBRARY THE BOOKSTOCK IS A HETEROGENOUS ENTITY WHICH CONSISTS
OF MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND LANGUAGES, WITH DIFFERENT CHRONOLOGICAL
AND REGIONAL CONNOTATIONS WHICH SERVE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF READERS. THUS, THE
AVAILABLE BOOKSTOCK NATURALLY SUBDIVIDES INTO A NUMBER OF ENTITIES WHICH
BELONG TO THE SAME CATEGORY AND THE SUBJECT MATTER APPEARS TO BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT CRITERION. LARGE LIBRARIES IN SLOVAKIA E.G. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES

LIBRARIANSHIP. SPECIAL PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK MAY CONSIST OF INTERNAL PUBLICATIONS
SUCH AS THESES, RESEARCH REPORTS, INTERNAL TRANSLATIONS AND OTHERS. IN DEALING
WITH PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH THE TYPE OF READER USING
IT (E.G. CHILDREN), THE PHYSICAL FORM OF THE STOCK (TRADITIONAL OR MICRO),

PERIODICALS FOR THE DISABLED' THEIR IMPORTANCE AS INFORMATION SOURCES.

RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION MANDATES INTEGRATION OF DISABLED AMERICANS INTO THE
MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY. THUS, THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
PHYSICALLY DISABLED. LIBRARIANS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS MUST GAIN AN
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERSPECTIVES AND CONCERNS OF DISABLED PEOPLE, AND THIS IS
BEST GAINED FROM PERSONAL CONTACT. WHERE THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, READING OF THE
PERIODICAL LITERATURE PUBLISHED FOR AND BY THE DISABLED IS RECOMMENDED. THESE
PERIODICALS HAVE CHANGED AS THE INFORMATION DEMANDS OF THE DISABLED HAVE
EVOLVED, AND THEY OFFER INFORMATION NOT FOUND ELSEWHERE. THEY CAN EDUCATE
LIBRARIANS, REHABILITATION WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE NEEDS AND
ABILITIES OF THE DISABLED IN THE USA.

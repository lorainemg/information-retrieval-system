EXCERPTS FROM MY BOUBOULINA FILE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN A TEXTBOOK AUTHOR'S AGREEING TO ALLOW STICKERS TO BE PLACED OVER
PORTIONS OF HER BOOK FOUND OBJECTIONABLE BY A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AND A
SUCCESSFUL WRITER'S AGREEING TO EXPURGATE PORTIONS OF HIS NOVEL TO CUT COSTS.
EXAMINES THESE DIFFERENCES BY TRACING THE CHAIN OF COMMAND OF CENSORSHIP WITH
WHICH AUTHORS MUST DEAL FROM ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN AN AUTHOR ON 1 SIDE AND
EDITORS, PUBLISHERS, TEACHERS, AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ON THE OTHER.
EXAMPLES FROM EACH LINK IN THE CHAIN ARE ILLUSTRATED WITH EXCERPTS FROM THE
AUTHOR'S PERSONAL FILE ON CENSORSHIP, CALLED 'BOUBOULINA'.

INTERNATIONALISM' AND THE CHILDREN'S LITERATURE COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED

APER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TERM
'INTERNATIONALISM' AS IT IS USED BY THOSE IN THE FIELD OF CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE IN THE USA. IT IS MOST COMMONLY APPLIED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES WHICH
CENTRE ON SOME PHASE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. ITS USE
APPEARS WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IN ARTICLES ON CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AND
SEMINAR PROGRAMMES. EXAMINATION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE TEXTBOOKS, THEMES FOR
DOCTORAL THESES PRESENTED 1930-79, AND THE STATUS OF LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS IN
GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES OF EDUCATION INDICATE THAT THE
INTERNATIONALISM OF THE FIELD IS INCLINED TO BE SUPERFICIAL.

GOOD LEGISLATION TOGETHER WITH COMPREHENSIVE STANDARDS WHICH ARE CONSTANTLY

TURKISH LIBRARY DEVELOPMENTS.
     
THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF LIBRARY SCIENCE CAME TO BE GRADUALLY APPRECIATED IN

STUDIES IN GERMANY. DETERMINED TO MAKE LIBRARIANSHIP A RECOGNISED PROFESSION,
HE CAMPAIGNED FOR A NATIONAL LIBRARY (ESTABLISHED IN 1946), TAUGHT LIBRARY
SCIENCE (BASIS OF DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AT ANKARA UNIVERSITY), AND
HELPED FOUND THE TURKISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN 1949. PUBLIC AND CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES HAVE INCREASED IN NUMBERS IN THE LAST DECADE (244 TO 700 AND 174 TO
400). THEIR PROBLEMS INCLUDE LACK OF TRAINED STAFF AND THE 180,000 MANUSCRIPTS
AND RARE BOOKS IN THEIR CARE. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN UNEVEN
AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE MOST NEGLECTED. TURDOK (NATIONAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRE

REPLACED IN 1975 BY THE TANZANIA LIBRARY SERVICES BOARD. THE BOARD'S FUNCTIONS
INCLUDE THE SUPERVISION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, THE TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS
AND THE PUBLICATION OF THE TANZANIA NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF

DO LIBRARIANS FEAR PROFESSIONALISM?.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION-SPONSORED PROGRAMME AT
THE MICHIGAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, 11 OCT 80. ARGUES THAT IN THE USA LIBRARIANS
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE DISTINCTIVE STATUS OF A PROFESSION. THEY HAVE
NO WAY OF MAKING THE CLAIM STICK THAT THEY HAVE CRUCIAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT THEY ARE AN OCCUPATIONAL GROUP
UNABLE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING AND PRESTIGE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP THROUGH TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL MEANS. BECAUSE OF LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS' EMPHASIS ON THE INSTITUTION, THERE IS A LACK OF CONCENTRATION ON
WHAT CONSTITUTES THE PROFESSIONAL BASIS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP; THE ASSOCIATIONS
HAVE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE THE LIBRARIAN HAS OCCUPATIONAL POWER WITHOUT
THE GROWING SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF PROFESSIONAL POWER.

BEEN INCREASED TO 68%, MAKING FINNISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES THE LARGEST RECIPIENTS
OF STATE AID IN SCANDINAVIA. THE 1978 PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER LIBRARY SERVICES
FROM THE SCHOOL BOARD TO THE EDUCATION MINISTRY HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED.

DOCUMENTATION AS A PART OF THE SYLLABUS AT DUTCH LIBRARY SCHOOLS.
     
THE TERM 'DOCUMENTATION' WAS 1ST USED BY PAUL OTLET OF THE INSTITUT
INTERNATIONAL DE BIBLIOGRAPHIE IN 1905. OTLET REGARDED 'BIBLIOGRAPHY' AS TOO
RESTRICTED A TERM TO COVER HIS ACTIVITIES. WITH THE INCREASING USE OF
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES IN THE 1960S USE OF THE TERM 'DOCUMENTATION'
HAS BECOME MORE FREQUENTLY APPLIED TO CERTAIN TASKS IN ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES.
IT IS THEREFORE UNREALISTIC TO CONSIDER LIBRARIANSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION AS
SEPARATE DISCIPLINES. AT THE FREDERIK MULLER SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN

ATTAINED FULL-TIME STATUS. THIS WAS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE SAVINGS INCURRED
WHEN THE LIBRARY, FORMERLY HOUSED IN A SCHOOL, BOUGHT SPACE IN A SHOPPING
CENTRE WHERE MANY SHOPS HAD HAD TO CLOSE. COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING METHODS WERE
USED TO ATTRACT READERS. THE LIBRARY IS NOW OPEN 20 HOURS A WEEK AND STAFF HAS
EXPANDED. THE DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN HELPED BY THE 2.4 MILLION KR. GRANT FROM
THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE, WHICH ALSO PARTLY COVERS RUNNING COSTS DURING THE
1ST 3 YEARS. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LIBRARIAN, OLE HANSEN, THE PROBLEMS OF A
RAPIDLY GROWING READERSHIP WERE DISCUSSED. HE IS HOPEFUL THAT ACQUISITIONS
WILL KEEP PACE WITH LOANS. SEES THE LIBRARY AS A PLACE WHERE DEMOCRACY IS
NURTURED AND WHERE PEOPLE CAN MEET AND FEEL AT HOME. INTERVIEWS LOCAL
POLITICIANS, WHO ARE SATISFIED WITH THE LIBRARY'S LOCATION AND HOPE TO BE ABLE
TO PRESERVE THE 4 PART-TIME BRANCHES. INTER VIEWS 2 OF THE PART-TIME
LIBRARIANS, WHO ARE RELIEVED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS OF ACCOUNTING AND
BOOK SELECTION HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEM TO THE MAIN LIBRARY, BUT WOULD LIKE
TO IMPROVE SERVICES TO THE ELDERLY.

LOANS TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY AFTER THE EXPANSION ON THE LACK OF POPULAR
TITLES. THE VERY LARGE OPEN PLAN ADULT LIBRARY MEANS LONG DISTANCES FOR

OF DEMANDS FOR EXTERNAL MATERIAL CAME FROM STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY EXAMINATION

STUDENTS, COVERING BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIALISED LITERATURE DEMANDS. THE
STUDENTS SHOW GREAT INTEREST IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS AND THEIR
INTEREST IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EQUALS THAT OF THE REST OF THE GENERAL
PUBLIC. THEY BORROW LESS FICTION THAN OTHER READERS, ALTHOUGH THEY DO USUALLY

LIBRARIES. BASED ON VISITS TO SIX LIBRARIES AND ATTENDANCE AT THE ANNUAL
CONFERENCE OF THE COMMITTEE ON EAST ASIAN LIBRARIES. THE CHIEF PROBLEM IN THE

DELETED. GRANTS FOR MODERN VIDEO-CASSETTE RECORDERS IN 1973 AND THE NEW

POLITICAL LITERATURE IN LIBRARIES OF THE RUSE REGION.
     
FROM 1974-79, SECTIONS OF POLITICAL LITERATURE IN 312 SELECTED PUBLIC, TRADE
UNION AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN THE RUSE REGION WERE THE SUBJECT OF A
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION. 2,018 READERS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AND 191
WERE INTERVIEWED. THE PROPORTION OF POLITICAL LITERATURE IN THE TOTAL BOOK
COLLECTIONS IS ON AVERAGE 20%. THE PEOPLE WHO STUDY POLITICAL LITERATURE ARE
PREDOMINANTLY STUDENTS OR PUPILS. REGRETTABLY, ONLY 31.7% OF THE READERS USED
LIBRARIES AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THEIR NECESSARY LITERATURE. MASS

ART TO THE PEOPLE.
     
ARGUES THAT LIBRARIES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN MAKING THE PUBLIC
FAMILIAR WITH ART. THE 1964 DANISH LIBRARY ACT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP ART
DEPARTMENTS AND SEVERAL LARGER LIBRARIES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS, LENDING
MOSTLY PRINTS, POSTERS AND SLIDES. THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS NOW STAGNATED OWING TO
VARIOUS MISCONCEPTIONS. THUS ART NEED NOT BE PLACED IN SPECIAL BUILDINGS ONLY
VISITED BY HIGHLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE. A LIBRARY SHOULD BEGIN BY LENDING POSTERS,
WHICH ARE EASY TO HANDLE, AND THEN PROCEED TO PRINTS. ART NEED NOT BE
EXPENSIVE, A POSTER COSTING NO MORE THAN A BOOK, AND LARGE COLLECTIONS ARE NOT
NECESSARY. WHEREAS ACQUISITION OF POSTERS IS SIMPLE, PRINTS AND SLIDES DEMAND
MORE ATTENTION AS CENTRAL AIDS TO SELECTION OF MATERIAL ARE LACKING.

DEDICATED LIBRARIANS ARE NEEDED TO DEVELOP SOCIAL LIBRARIANSHIP. FREEDOM IN
BOOK SELECTION IS OFTEN THREATENED BY THE ATTITUDE OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BY
CONDITIONS ON THE BOOK MARKET. PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN GERMANY HAVE DEVELOPED NOT

1 COORDINATED REPORT COMPILED BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT.
SEPARATE RETURNS CAN BE POSITIVELY MISLEADING, SINCE, FOR INSTANCE, BOOKS
TRANSFERRED OR CIRCULATING WITHIN A LIBRARY SYSTEM CANNOT BE ACCURATELY
RECORDED. PUTS FORWARD PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THE TIME SPENT ON STATISTICS; THE
TYPE REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY THE LIBRARY'S PLACE IN SOCIETY WERE TO BE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF A SALARIED COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS. BOOKSTOCK STANDARDS
WOULD ALSO BE MORE VIABLE IF FORMULATED FOR 1 AUTHORITY, WITH THE NECESSARY
DIVISIONS INTO CENTRAL LIBRARY AND BRANCHES. THE STATUS AND FUNCTION OF THE
COUNTY LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE IS QUERIED, AND THE RIGHT OF WORKERS'
ORGANISATIONS TO REPRESENTATION ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL IS STRESSED.

ARE COUNTY LIBRARIES THREATENED?.
     
THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT REPORT NOU 1979 PROPOSES THAT FROM 1981 STATE GRANTS
TOWARDS COUNTY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CEASE, BEING REPLACED BY ADDITIONAL TAX
INCOME. THE INTENTION IS TO SIMPLIFY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND
INCREASE THE COUNTIES' ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTONOMY.
CONCENTRATING ON TECHNICAL DETAILS, THE REPORT IGNORES THEIR EFFECT ON
PROFESSIONS AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREAS CONCERNED. CULTURAL WORK IS DEFINED AS
A VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY FOR COUNTIES, NOT REQUIRING OR MERITING STATE SUPPORT;
LIBRARIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ALREADY UNDER SOME DEGREE OF STATE SUPERVISION.
STATE SUPPORT HAS BEEN A STIMULUS TO CULTURAL LIFE IN RURAL AREAS, AND ITS
REMOVAL WOULD BE A RETROGRADE STEP. THE PROPOSALS, IF IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT
FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY, COULD
LEAD TO GREATLY VARYING STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES,
ALSO AFFECTING SCHOOLS AND ADULT EDUCATION. THIS WOULD BE DI RECTLY COUNTER TO
THE 'EQUALITY PRINCIPLE' IN THE CURRENT LIBRARY ACT.

GREAT DIFFERENCES IN THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND LEVEL OF SERVICES OF RESEARCH
LIBRARIES.
     
COMMENTS ON THE SECTIONS OF A REPORT BY THE RESEARCH PLANNING COUNCIL' 2THE
CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR1 WHICH DEAL WITH RESEARCH
LIBRARIES. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE REDUCTION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR
ACQUISITION OF LITERATURE HAS LED TO SEVERE PROBLEMS FOR RESEARCH. ANALYSIS OF
THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1970S SHOWS INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE ON STAFF AND FALL
IN THE REAL VALUE OF THAT FOR ACQUISITIONS, TOGETHER WITH A DOUBLING OF
ISSUES. THE COMEMNTS ON LIBRARIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT, BUT CAN
BE CLASSED AS THOSE THAT MENTION' LIBRARIES WITHOUT PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION,
OR LIBRARIES WHERE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT YET ARISEN, AND LIBRARIES WITH
CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS. ARTS FACULTIES HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN SUBJECTS AND
FOREIGN SPECIALISED LITERATURE COINCIDING WITH A DECREASE IN BOOK GRANTS. IN
THE NATURAL SCIENCE FACULTIES, INSTITUTE LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ACQUIRE
BOOKS WHICH WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM A RESEARCH LIBRARY; GAPS
ARE APPEARING IN RUNS OF PERIODICALS, AND REFERENCE WORKS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.
SERVICE LEVEL HAS GONE DOWN AS A RESULT OF UNDERMANNING OF LIBRARIES. SOME
LIBRARIES, FOR EXAMPLE THOSE OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND THE COMMERCIAL HIGH
SCHOOLS, STAND OUT AS PARTICULARLY HARD HIT.

THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES' IDEAS FOR A NEW VIEWPOINT.
     
ALTHOUGH LIBRARIANS FORMERLY ADOPTED A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE WHEN INTRODUCING
AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING, ITS USE RESULTED IN ERGONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS AND MORE
INTERESTING WORK FOR SOME STAFF. THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING CAN,
HOWEVER, CAUSE STRESS AND MONOTONY, THE CONTROL OF WORK AND HUMAN POTENTIAL BY
MACHINES, INCREASED ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUALS, THE DOWNGRADING OF SOME LIBRARY
POSTS AND THE LOSS OF A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE FOR READERS. IF THE HUMAN TOUCH IS
TO BE RETAINED IN LIBRARIES, NEW STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED. GOOD COMMUNICATION

CENTRE WILL EVENTUALLY ACT AS A DATA BASE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY LITERATURE AND A
CENTRE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY COMPUTER OPERATIONS. LOCAL SYSTEMS ARE VIABLE ONLY
FOR THE LARGEST LIBRARIES; SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARIES MUST BE LINKED TO

NESSEBY LIBRARY' A BIG EFFORT FOR A SMALL AUTHORITY.
     
NESSEBY, IN NORTHERN NORWAY, IS LARGE IN AREA (1,438 SQ.KIL.) BUT SMALL IN
POPULATION (1,120 INHABITANTS). AFTER MANY YEARS OF INADEQUATE LIBRARY
ACCOMMODATION, A NEW COMMUNITY CENTRE INCLUDING A LIBRARY WAS OPENED IN 1980,
SO WELCOME THAT THE INCREASED FINANCIAL BURDEN IS NOT RESENTED. THE LIBRARY IS
IN THE BASEMENT, BUT SLOPING GROUND ALLOWS AMPLE WINDOW SPACE. FOR THE 1ST
TIME THERE IS A LOAN COUNTER, A LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE, AND ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE
4,500 BOOKS. THE ADDITION OF A PROPOSED MOBILE LIBRARY WOULD ENSURE A GOOD
LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE AREA, THOUGH EXPANSION WILL BE NECESSARY IN TIME.

DOES TRONDHEIM NEED A PUBLIC LIBRARY? OPEN LETTER TO THE PARTY MEMBERS IN THE
TOWN COUNCIL.
     
THE STAFF OF TRONDHEIM PUBLIC LIBRARY, NORWAY, CONSIDER THE LATEST
POSTPONEMENT (TILL AFTER 1982) OF THE PLANNED NEW LIBRARY TOTALLY
IRRESPONSIBLE. HAVING LONG TOLERATED UNSATISFACTORY CONDITIONS IN THE
EXPECTATION OF IMPROVEMENT, THEY NOW DEMAND THAT THE PRESENT LIBRARY SHOULD BE
BROUGHT UP TO CURRENT STANDARDS OF HEALTH AND WORK ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS,
THOUGH EVEN THIS WOULD NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. MUCH OF THE
BOOKSTOCK IS HOUSED ELSEWHERE FOR LACK OF SPACE, WHICH TOGETHER WITH STAFF
SHORTAGES MAKES FOR UNSATISFACTORY PUBLIC SERVICE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTEND
SERVICES TO THE ELDERLY, HANDICAPPED AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. ONLY A
NEW LIBRARY CAN BRING TRONDHEIM INTO LINE WITH OTHER NORWEGIAN CITY LIBRARY

A STUDY OF INFORMATION CHANNELS IN TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION' THEIR ROLE IN
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.
     
SUMMARY OF A BRAZILIAN DISSERTATION PRESENTED FOR A HIGHER DEGREE IN
INFORMATION SCIENCE, BASED CHIEFLY ON RECENT LITERATURE, BRAZILIAN AND
FOREIGN. THE STUDY COVERS THE PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION IN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY; USER CHARACTERISTICS; THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION AND INFORMATION CHANNELS; AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND INFORMATION
CHANNELS. THIS ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IN
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES, INFORMAL CHANNELS OF TECHNICAL
COMMUNICATION ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. PROPOSES WAYS IN WHICH RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT MANAGERS CAN MAXIMISE USE OF HUMAN RESOURCES THROUGH MANIPULATION
OF THE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WITHIN THE ORGANISATION, THROUGH INVESTIGATION
OF THE EXISTING COMMUNICATION/INFORMATION ROLES AS INFORMATION PROCESSING
SYSTEMS. THESE ROLES CONSTITUTE THE TRUE AGENTS OF TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION ,
BOTH WITHIN THE ORGANISATION AND BETWEEN SEPARATE ORGANISATIONS. PARTICULAR
REFERENCE IS MADE TO RECENT BRAZILIAN RESEARCH.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE INFORMATION '81' FORECASTS
AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, 22-25 SEPT 81. OUTLINES THE PATTERN OF
LIBRARY SERVICES AVAILABLE TO STAFF IN THE UK NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE (N.H.S.)
AND GIVES A PRELIMINARY REPORT OF A STUDY OF LIBRARY USAGE AND OF ATTITUDES
TOWARD LIBRARIES AMONG CLINICAL AND PRE-CLINICAL STAFF AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY.
LIBRARIES SERVING N.H.S. STAFF ARE NUMEROUS BUT SMALL, MOST COMMONLY BEING
STAFFED BY A SINGLE LIBRARIAN, AND RECEIVE LITTLE PUBLICITY. IN SPITE OF THEIR
SMALL SIZE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER HAVE A 'SPECIAL LIBRARY' CHARACTER. TEACHING
HOSPITAL LIBRARIES REPRESENT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE
N.H.S. LIBRARY SYSTEMS AND ARE THE LARGEST OF THE LIBRARIES SERVING N.H.S.
STAFF. DATA ON USAGE AND ATTITUDES WERE COLLECTED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT METHODS
IN THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS WOULD GIVE A RICHER PICTURE THAN WOULD BE
PROVIDED BY ANY ONE OF CONVENTIONAL SURVEY TECHNIQ UES. DISCUSSES THE USE OF
MODELLING METHODS FOR INTERPRETING DATA.

USE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE IN CEREALS RESEARCH.
     
THE USE AND EFFECT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE ON CEREALS RESEARCH IN
NIGERIA WAS DETERMINED BY USING A MULTI-METHOD APPROACH. ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND
INDIGENOUS AFRICAN LANGUAGE LITERATURE WAS EXCLUDED. LANGUAGES INCLUDED WERE
FRENCH, GERMAN, SPANISH, RUSSIAN, JAPANESE AND CHINESE. METHODS USED IN THE
SURVEY WERE A TWO-YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE LOANS RECORDS OF THE NATIONAL CEREALS
RESEARCH INSTITUTE LIBRARY, QUESTIONNAIRES DISTRIBUTED TO RESEARCH SCIENTISTS
AND ANALYSES OF THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE REFERENCES IN RECENT PUBLICATIONS AND
THESES OF THE SCIENTISTS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT SCIENTISTS MAKE LITTLE USE OF
FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE BECAUSE FEW OF THEM ARE ABLE TO READ THESE
LANGUAGES. CONSEQUENTLY SCIENTISTS ARE MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND THERE
IS DUPLICATION OF RESEARCH WHICH USE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE COULD
MINIMISE. RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT FRENCH, GERMAN, CHINESE AND JAPANESE ARE
IMPORTANT IN CEREALS RESEARCH.

TECHNOLOGY AND THE INFORMATION PROFESSIONAL: WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?.
     
EXAMINES THE LIKELY IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY ON LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION
SCIENTISTS, AND ON DATA BASE PRODUCERS, OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. DATA BASE
PRODUCERS WILL INCREASINGLY RELY ON HOME-BASED ABSTRACTORS WHO RECEIVE, CREATE
AND SEND ALL THEIR MATERIAL BY ELECTRONIC MEANS. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH
PROCEDURES FOR THE DATA BASE PRODUCERS ARE OUTLINED. INCREASING USE OF
VIDEODISCS FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL IS ENVISAGED. THE IMPACT OF
NEW TECHNOLOGY ON LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS IS THEN EXAMINED. USE
OF VIDEODISCS WILL MEAN A DECLINE IN THE USE OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
USE OF INTELLIGENT TERMINALS WILL LEAD TO GREATER USE OF THESE SYSTEMS BY
END-USERS. THE INTELLIGENT TERMINALS COULD BE USED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE
LANGUAGES, TO REFINE SEARCH STRATEGIES, TO STORE AND EDIT OUTPUT FROM SEARCHES
AND TO ADVISE USERS ON THE BEST DATA BASES AND BEST SEARCH STRATEGY TO USE.
ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THOSE LEADING TO THE 'OFFICE OF
THE FUTURE'. CONCLUDES THAT THERE WILL BE A DRAMATIC SHAKEOUT IN
LIBRARIANSHIP, BUT THAT INFORMATION SCIENTISTS FACE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO
DEVELOP THEIR SKILLS BY THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT SCHOOLS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE TEACH THEIR STUDENTS TYPING
SKILLS. FINALLY, SOME REMARKS ABOUT THE ADVISABILITY OF OFFERING SOPHISTICATED
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS TO LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE MADE.

MONOGRAPHS IN MICROFORM' ISSUES IN CATALOGUING AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL.
     
DURING THE LAST 20 YEARS, MICROFORM ACQUISITIONS HAVE GROWN AT AN INCREDIBLE
RATE ALONG WITH WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION OF INADEQUATE BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO
THESE MATERIALS. LOCAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OVER MONOGRAPHS IN MICROFORM HAS
BEEN A PARTICULAR PROBLEM-RESEARCH LIBRARIES HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE
CATALOGUING FOR THESE MATEIALS WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF EFFORT AND PRIORITY
ACCORDED TO SIMILAR MATERIALS IN HARD COPY. IDENTIFIES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE
MICROFORM PROBLEM, REVIEWS THE HISTORY OF ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES REGARDING
THE CATALOGUING OF MICROFORMS AND SUGGESTS THAT INTEGRATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC
ACCESS BE IMPLEMENTED AT LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS IN THE USA.

CLASSIFICATION OF READERS-USERS OF SPECIAL RECOMMENDED INDEXES.
     
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEM OF CLASSIFICATION OF READERS INTO GROUPS, ACCORDING TO
THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPILATION OF LISTS OF
RECOMMENDED READINGS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO SHOW THE POSSIBILITIES
OF THE APPLICATION OF CRITERIA WHOSE INTERACTION DEFINES A TYPE OF INFORMATION
NEED OF A GROUP. CRITERIA ARE BASED ON A SERIES OF INDICATORS ABLE TO EXPRESS
ESSENTIAL AND GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF READERS. CONCENTRATING ON FINE ARTS
BIBLIOGRAPHIES PRODUCES A MODEL OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF READERS INTO 4 BASIC,
EXPANDABLE GROUPS' STUDENTS OF TECHNICAL COLLEGES, SECONDARY VOCATIONAL
SCHOOLS AND WORKING YOUTH; STUDENTS AND INTELLIGENTSIA; NON-PROFESSIONAL
ARTISTS; AND READERS PROFESSIONALLY CONNECTED WITH THE PROMOTION OF THE FINE

THE UTILIZATION OF AGRINDEX IN THE CARIBBEAN.
     
A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE INFORMATION HABITS AND NEEDS OF
THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCHES IN THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES OF THE CARIBBEAN
REGION WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE USE OF AGRINDEX. THE SURVEY REVEALED
THAT AGRINDEX IS USED BY AND KNOWN TO ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS AND
POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS ARE DISCUSSED. FROM ALL INDICATIONS IT SEEMS THAT
THERE IS A NEED FOR AN INFORMATION SERVICE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ABSTRACTS AND
REVIEWS OF REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL LITERATURE AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON RESEARCH
IN PROGRESS. TWO RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE; ONE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A USER
EDUCATION PROGRAMME WHICH WOULD ENSURE WIDER USE OF AGRINDEX AND THE SECOND
FOR A SUB-REGIONAL CO-ORDINATION CENTRE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES.

SERIALS CONTROL.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB CONFERENCE INFORMATION '81' FORECASTS AND
REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. SERIALS CONTROL IS THROUGHT
TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF LIBRARY HOUSEKEEPING PROCESSES TO AUTOMATE. NO
AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM HAS YET BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE
COST-EFFECTIVE. MINICOMPUTER BASED SYSTEMS SHOW PROMISE OF MORE EFFICIENT
OPERATION. STUDIES AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY HAVE SHOWN THE FEASIBILITY OF
AUTOMATED SERIALS CHECK-IN BEING ACHIEVED FASTER THAN IS POSSIBLE MANUALLY.
FURTHER STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE
SYSTEM TO BE COST-EFFECTIVE. PREDICTION OF THE ARRIVAL DATE FOR IRREGULAR
SERIALS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. THE DIFFICULTIES (AND EXPENSE) OF UPDATING FILES
IN REAL-TIME REPRESENTS ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR WHICH A TENTATIVE SOLUTION IS
PROPOSED. THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE USER INTERFACE IS EMPHASISED AND THIS IS ONE

PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION IN THEATER LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
PROBLEMS IN CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFYING THEATRE RESOURCES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THEATRE LIBRARIANSHIP. THE UNSUITABILITY OF
MAJOR EXISTING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR USE WITH THEATRE COLLECTIONS HAS
PROMPTED LIBRARIANS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS MODIFICATIONS AND ORIGINAL
CLASSIFICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, COLLECTIONS OF NON-BOOK, OR 'FUGITIVE',
THEATRICAL MEMORABILIA ARE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CATALOGUE PROPERLY, GIVEN
THE DESPERATE FINANCIAL SITUATION FACING MANY THEATRE COLLECTIONS. US SURVEY
DATA ON CURRENT PRACTICES INDICATE A STRONG TREND TOWARD STANDARDISATION OF
PROCEDURES IN CLASSIFYING, YET A CONTINUING DIVERSITY IN CATALOGUING METHODS.
THE COMING OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, ALONG WITH INCREASED AWARENESS AMONG
THEATRE LIBRARIANS AND INPUT FROM CONCERNED PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS, MAY
HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE.

HOW DO LIBRARIES CATALOGUE.
     
THE WORKING GROUP ON CATALOGUING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEYED THE FINNISH
PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM TO FIND OUT ABOUT CATALOGUING METHODS IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. 461 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT AND 409 WERE RETURNED. THE WORKING
GROUP IS DESIGNING A COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
JUST OVER 70% OF THE RESPONDENTS USE FINNISH CATALOGUING RULES. JUST UNDER 50%
OF THE RESPONDENTS USE THEIR OWN SUBJECT INDEXING AND NEARLY 87% OF THE
RESPONDENTS USE THE 1975 EDITION OF THE FINNISH CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BASED ON
DEWEY. OVER 50% USE THE CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SERVICE OF KIRJASTOPALVELU OY,
AND NEARLY 60% OF THE RESPONDING LIBRARY AUTHORITIES UNDERTAKE CENTRALISED

EFFORTS MADE SINCE THE MID 19TH CENTURY TO PRODUCE ALPHABETICAL UNION
CATALOGUES OF ALL BOOKS WITHIN A UNIVERSITY HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY THE
DIFFICULTY OF ACCESS TO SOME INSTITUTE LIBRARY STOCKS, BY INACCURATE
CATALOGUING IN INSTITUTE LIBRARIES AND BY THE QUESTIONABLE VALUE OF A CENTRAL
CATALOGUE WITHIN PURCHASING POLICY. SINCE 1970, HOWEVER, PROFESSIONAL OPINION
HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY IN FAVOUR OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES; WORK IN
THIS FIELD AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES IS DESCRIBED AND EVALUATED THROUGH ANALYSIS
OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN FIGURES. THESE CATALOGUES SHOULD BE PRODUCED ONLY WHEN
CERTAIN CONDITIONS PREVAIL, E.G. WHEN INSTITUTE STOCK SUBJECT COVERAGE IS MUCH
WIDER THAN THAT OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY, WHEN ACCESS TO THE UNION CATALOGUE IS
EASY AND WHEN THE CATALOGUE CAN BE PRODUCED WITHOUT DETRIMENT TO OTHER WORK.

WHY STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES?.
     
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE GROWTH AND SPREAD IN THE USE OF ON-LINE
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN LESS DRAMATIC THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EXPECTED. ONE OF THE OBSTACLES FACING THE USER IS THE NEED TO MASTER MANY
DIVERSE USER INTERFACES. SEVERAL SOLUTIONS ARE OFFERED, YET, THE ONLY ONE
WHICH IS REALLY OPEN AT PRESENT IS TO DECLINE TO USE ALL BUT 1 OR 2 FAMILIAR
SYSTEMS, ACCEPTING THAT SOME POTENTIALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION WILL BE MISSED.
THE MAIN ALTERNATIVES SEEM TO BE THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDS BY SYSTEM OPERATORS
OR THE USE OF TRANSLATING SOFTWARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE USER AND THE
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE MICROPROCESSOR AND THE INTELLIGENT
TERMINAL, THIS LATTER ALTERNATIVE BECOMES MORE ATTRACTIVE AND IT MAY APPEAR,
AT 1ST SIGHT, THAT THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES IS THEREFORE
LESSENED, OR EVEN DISAPPEARS TOTALLY. HOWEVER, CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OFFERED LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ADOPTI ON OF STANDARDS
WILL BE MORE RATHER THAN LESS IMPORTANT IF MUCH OF THE POTENTIAL IS TO BE
REALISED.

SEARCH METHODS HAS INCREASED USE OF THEIR REFERENCE SERVICE BY BUSINESSMEN AND
HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF IN PARTICULAR. HERTFORDSHIRE COUNTY LIBRARY INSTALLED A
TERMINAL IN 1975 AND CARRIED OUT ON-LINE SEARCHES; AS A RESULT IT WAS ABLE TO
CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SOME REFERENCE WORKS. IN 1981 IT ACQUIRED AN SCL
MICROCOMPUTER FOR ACCESSION AND ISSUE CONTROL. BIRMINGHAM CENTRAL LIBRARY HAS
A TERMINAL IN THE TECHNICAL REFERENCE ROOM, WITH ACCESS BY ALL DEPARTMENTS,
BUT NOT THE PUBLIC. IT REGARDS THE ON-LINE SERVICE ONLY AS AN ADDITIONAL
REFERENCE TOOL. NONE OF THE LIBRARIES UNDERTOOK COMPUTER SEARCHES OF THEIR OWN
STOCK, BUT ONLY IN INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES. LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT SEARCH
EFFIC IENCY INCREASED IF USERS WERE INTERVIEWED FIRST, BUT NOT PRESENT DURING
THE ACTUAL SEARCH, AND THAT THOSE CARRYING OUT THE SEARCH SHOULD BE
EXPERIENCED REFERENCE LIBRARIANS SPECIALISING IN A PARTICULAR BASE. RAISES THE
QUESTION OF THE EFFECT ON PUBLICATION OF REFERENCE WORKS IN PAPER EDITIONS OF
THE GROWTH OF ON-LINE SEARCH FACILITIES. (FOR PART 1 2SEE BIBLIOTEK 70 1(17)

THE ON-LINE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED RAPID GROWTH IN THE PAST DECADE, AND THE
BIBLIOGRAPHY BUSINESS FILES ARE EMERGING AS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING AREAS
OF THE INDUSTRY. A NUMBER OF TRENDS IN THE INDUSTRY ARE IDENTIFIED, AND THEIR
EFFECTS ON BIBLIOGRAPHIC BUSINESS DATA BASES ARE ANALYSED. A KEY TREND IS THAT
OF THE AVAILABILITY OF MORE FULL-TEXT DATA BASES. IN THE NEXT 3-5 YEARS
'HYBRID FILES' CONSISTING OF INDEXING, ABSTRACTS, AND THE FULL TEXTS OF
DOCUMENTS WILL EMERGE AS A DESIRABLE STRUCTURE FOR NEW BIBLIOGRAPHIC BUSINESS
DATA BASES.

THE DARC SUBSTRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEM A SEARCHER'S EXPERIENCE.
     
THE SEARCH QUESTIONS OF THE CHEMIST OFTEN RELATE TO A CLASS OF SUBSTANCES
(I.E. HE DESIRES INFORMATION ON ALL INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS WHICH HAVE PARTICULAR
PARTIAL STRUCTURES IN COMMON). IN DARC, AN EFFECTIVE SEARCH PROGRAMME IS
AVAILABLE WHICH ALLOWS THESE COMPOUNDS TO BE SOUGHT OUT FROM A VERY LARGE FUND
OF STRUCTURES (4.5 MILLION) AND THE STRUCTURE DIAGRAM OF EACH COMPOUND WITH
THE ASSOCIATED REGISTRY NUMBER TO BE REPRESENTED ON THE SCREEN OF A GRAPHIC
DISPLAY TERMINAL. IT IS POSSIBLE, IN ADDITION, TO USE THE RESULT OF THIS
SEARCH, IN THE FORM OF A LIST OF REGISTRY NUMBERS, AS SEARCH PARAMETERS IN A
BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE, IF NECESSARY IN COMBINATION WITH NON-STRUCTURAL
INFORMATION.

USE OF JOIS AT TOKYO WOMEN'S MEDICAL COLLEGE LIBRARY.
     
SINCE THE COMPUTERISED RETRIEVAL SERVICE, JOIS, WAS MADE AVAILABLE AT TOKYO
WOMEN'S MEDICAL COLLEGE IN APR 79, THE NUMBER OF LITERATURE RETRIEVAL REQUESTS
INCREASED BY MORE THAN 100%. HOWEVER, MANUAL LITERATURE SEARCHES USING
JAPANESE INDEXING JOURNALS ARE STILL BEING CONTINUED FOR 2 REASONS' (1)
ON-LINE DATA BASES INCLUDED IN JOIS ONLY COVER THE LAST 5 YEARS OF LITERATURE;
(2) JAPANESE LITERATURE IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED. OF THE DATA BASES AVAILABLE
ON JOIS, MEDLARS WAS USED THE MOST, FOLLOWED BY TOXLINE. THE AVERAGE SEARCH
TIME WAS 7 MINUTES FOR ALL DATA BASES. 3 MEDLARS SEARCH SAMPLES ARE SHOWN.

THE VALUE OF CONTROLLED INDEXING SYSTEMS IN ONLINE TEXT DATABASES.
     
WHILE THE VALUE OF CONTROLLED INDEXING TO SUPPLEMENT TEXT SEARCHING IS
RECOGNISED IN LIMITED TEXT (E.G. BIBLIOGRAPHIC) DATA BASES, TEXT SEARCHING IS
USUALLY THOUGHT TO GIVE SUFFICIENT SUBJECT ACCESS TO FULL TEXT DATA BASES.
ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM INFORMATION SCIENCE, COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND LINGUISTICS
ARE PUT FORWARD IN FAVOUR OF USING SOME FORM OF CONTROLLED LANGUAGE IN FULL
TEXT DATA BASES. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH A SYSTEM IN MARTINDEX, A FULL TEXT

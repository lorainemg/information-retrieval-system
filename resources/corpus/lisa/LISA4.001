COPYRIGHT SHOULD REST ON AGREEMENTS NOT FORCE.
     
INTERVIEWS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COPYRIGHT LAW REVISION COMMITTEE, MOGENS
KOKTVEDGAARD. HE ARGUES THAT THE PROPOSALS CONTAIN NO CHANGE OF PRINCIPLE, BUT
THAT THE PROBLEM OF PROFESSIONAL COPYING OF MUSICAL WORKS ESPECIALLY HAS BEEN
TACKLED; MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENT FOR INFRINGEMENTS OF COPYRIGHT IS ENVISAGED.
PHOTOCOPYING OF PRINTED MATTER BY EDUCATIONAL AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IS BEING
BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL WITH BETTER SYSTEMS OF REPORTING USE. IT IS UP TO THE
ORGANISATIONS REPRESENTING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS TO PRODUCE A SYSTEM OF
COLLECTIVE ADMINISTRATION FOR DEALING WITH USERS. ABOLITION OF COPYRIGHT,
ARGUED BY THOSE WHO WANT A FREE MARKET IN CULTURAL PRODUCTS, WOULD LEAD TO THE
DEATH OF CULTURE. LICENCE AGREEMENTS ARE MUCH TO BE PREFERRED TO COMPULSORY
LICENCES. BUT SUCH A SYSTEM MUST BE COMBINED WITH FORMS OF STATE SUPPORT FOR
THE PRODUCERS.

THE POSITION OF THE BOOK IN FINLAND.
     
FINLAND HAS PROPORTIONATELY A VERY LARGE NATIONAL BOOK PRODUCTION (710 VOLUMES
PER MILLION POPULATION IN 1970, AS AGAINST 280 IN USA). BOOK LOANS/SALES HAVE
INCREASED FROM 17.4/4.9 PER HEAD IN 1950 TO 32.4/13.6 IN 1970, WHILE THE
PROPORTION OF FICTION PUBLISHED FELL FROM ONE-THIRD TO 10-15%. LIBRARY LOANS
INCREASED SEVENFOLD DURING 1945-70, WHILE BORROWERS INCREASED FROM 8% TO 26%
OF POPULATION. THE FIRST MOBILE LIBRARY APPEARED IN 1961; BY 1971 THERE WERE
73, LENDING 8% OF THE NATIONAL TOTAL. BOOK-CLUBS CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS AUTHORS'
ROYALTIES AND GRANTS. FINNISH AUTHORS ARE LESS WELL SUBSIDISED THAN NORWEGIAN,

GREEK THEORY OF THE SIGN EXPRESSING THE RELATION BETWEEN WORDS, THOUGHTS, AND
THINGS WHICH IS STILL INFLUENTIAL IN PHILOSOPHY, LINGUISTICS, AND PSYCHOLOGY,
BUT IS OFTEN INAPPROPRIATELY INVOKED IN THESE DISCIPLINES AND IN LIBRARY AND

AN IDEA OF LIBRARIANSHIP: AN OUTLINE FOR A ROOT-METAPHOR THEORY IN LIBRARY
SCIENCE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. WITH GROWTH COMES COMPLEXITY; AND LIBRARIANSHIP BECOMES
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS IT GROWS. A 2-FOLD APPROACH TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF
LIBRARIANSHIP IS SUGGESTED. FIRSTLY, LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A
GENERAL DISCIPLINE AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE STUDIED AS A WHOLE, AND
SECONDLY, BASIC COMPONENTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED, BY REDUCING
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FIELD TO ITS SIMPLEST PARTS-ITS 'ROOTS'. PROPOSES A
MODEL OF 'METALIBRARIANSHIP' BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, AND INVOLVING ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT ITS NATURE IN TERMS OF THE MECHANISM, EXPANDED CONTEXTUALISM AND
FORMISM, AND SUGGESTING THAT THE PRIMARY ROOT METAPHOR OF METALIBRARIANSHIP IS
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GENERIC BOOK, ITS SUBJECT MATTER, AND ITS READER.

THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE ADVENT OF DATA PROCESSING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE HAS IMPROVED THE
STANDING OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A PROFESSION AND AT THE SAME TIME CREATED A
DEMAND FOR BETTER QUALIFICATIONS, ESPECIALLY GRADUATE ENTRY. LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN PUTTING PRESSURE ON LOCAL AND
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE THE STATUS OF THEIR MEMBERS. THIS STATUS VARIES
CONSIDERABLY FROM 1 COUNTRY TO ANOTHER, ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL TREND IS UPWARDS,
AND FROM 1 KIND OF LIBRARY TO ANOTHER. IN SOME UNIVERSITIES, LIBRARIANS ENJOY
FULL ACADEMIC STATUS, BUT A LIBRARIAN MUST BE MORE THAN A PURE ACADEMIC AND
MUST BE PROFICIENT IN THE PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATIVE SKILLS AS WELL.

THE FUTURE COURSE OF ARCHIVAL THEORY IN THE UNITED STATES.
     
ARCHIVISTS WISHING TO PURSUE THE CONCEPT OF ARCHIVAL THEORY MUST FIRST DEFINE
THAT CONCEPT AND THEN WEIGH THEIR DEFINITION AGAINST THE WORK DONE IN THE
FIELD SO FAR. ONE APPROACH WOULD BE TO CONSIDER THEORY AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
UNIVERSAL LAWS, AND TO FRAME HYPOTHESES IN UNIVERSAL FORM AND TEST THEM
AGAINST THE EVIDENCE. ADDRESSES THE LIKELY FUTURE TRENDS IN US ARCHIVAL THEORY
AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, CONCLUDING THAT THERE IS HOPE FOR THE PROFESSION IF'
(1) THE PROFESSION ITSELF REALISES THAT IT IS BOTH A SCIENCE AND A CRAFT; AND
(2) CERTAIN ARCHIVISTS MAKE THE MOVE FROM THE WORKPLACE TO THE ACADEMY AS A
PERMANENT CAREER COMMITMENT. THERE THEY MUST REALIGN THEMSELVES WITH ACADEMIC
HISTORIANS AND OTHERS TO PRODUCE A BODY OF BASIC PRINCIPLES, A SYSTEM OF
IMMUTABLE LAWS-A LITANY OF THEORY AND DOGMA.

ON THE PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF THE LIBRARIAN FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF EDUCATION
AND TRAINING.
     
SOCIALIST LIBRARY SYSTEMS AIM TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE PEOPLE
IN ALL SUBJECTS, TO PROVIDE SOUND COMMUNIST TRAINING AND TO SUPPORT THE
FURTHER GROWTH OF SOCIALIST SOCIETY. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS
MUST, THEREFORE, BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE OBJECTIVES. THE LIBRARIAN HAS A
RESPONSIBILITY TO SOCIETY TO PROVIDE FOR THE GROWING DEMAND FOR LITERATURE AND
INFORMATION, TO FURTHER RESEARCH STUDY AND TO SUPPORT SOCIALIST EDUCATION.
WHATEVER BRANCH OF LIBRARY WORK THE STUDENT WILL EVENTUALLY BE INVOLVED IN,
TRAINING SHOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED TO LEARNING FACTS AND LIBRARY METHODOLOGY
TECHNIQUES BUT SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE A FLEXIBLE TRAINING IN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC
ASPECTS OF LIBRARY WORK. A LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELATE HIS PARTICULAR
SOCIAL ROLE IN HIS BRANCH OF LIBRARY WORK TO THE SOCIALIST LIBRARY SYSTEM AS A
WHOLE.

BASED KNOWLEDGE AND GOOD PRACTICAL CAREER TRAINING. A STUDENT FOLLOWS COURSES
IN SUBJECTS RELATED TO LIBRARY SCIENCE, MARXISM AND LENINISM, AND FOREIGN

IN DIFFERENT PUBLIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES MAKE UP PART OF THE COURSE.
LIBRARIAN STUDENTS ALSO ATTEND COURSES IN SUBJECTS SUCH AS INFORMATION
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MODERN MEDIA TO ENABLE THEM TO FOLLOW FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE FIELDS AFFECTING THE LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE COURSE OF STUDY
LASTS 8 TERMS, THE LAST OF WHICH IS SPENT IN A LIBRARY DOING PRACTICAL WORK

LITERATURE INFORMATION AND METHODS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ACTIVITY; HISTORIC
DEVELOPMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT LEVEL OF GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT
LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT LEVEL OF RECOMMENDATORY BIBLIOGRAPHY
IN EAST GERMANY AND USSR; AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY. THESE 7 THEMES
ARE CLOSELY LINKED AND INTERSECT IN MANY AREAS ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE
BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY, WHICH OFTEN ACCOMPANIES OTHER THEMES. THE COURSE
IN BIBLIOGRAPHY IS A BALANCED MIXTURE OF THEORY AND PRACTICE. IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE EDUCATED TO THE ADVANCED LEVEL OF BIBLIOGRAPHY AS IT
EXISTS IN EAST GERMANY AND USSR. THE TIME ALLOTTED TO THE COURSE IS NOT
ADEQUATE AND STUDENTS HAVE TO STUDY INDEPENDEN TLY WHICH REQUIRES A GOOD
KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES AS MUCH OF THE COURSE LITERATURE IS IN RUSSIAN AND

SCHOOL LIBRARY-PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
REPORT OF A LECTURE GIVEN TO THE ANNUAL MEETING OF DENMARK'S SCHOOL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, 1981 BY PETER SEEBERG. THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF SCHOOL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN DENMARK IS REVIEWED AND DOUBTS ARE CAST ON THE GENUINENESS
OF OFFICIAL DANISH LIBERALISM IN RELATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ATTITUDE
TO LIBRARIES. SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ORIGINATED FROM 2 ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
CONCEPTS' IN SCHOOLS CHILDREN HAD OTHERS TO THINK FOR THEM; LIBRARIES IN
DENMARK AROSE FROM THE LATE 19TH CENTURY IDEA OF CULTURE FOR ALL AND ACCESS
FOR ALL TO EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW. BY THE 1930S LIBRARIES HAD BECOME
INSTIGATORS OF CULTURE, WITH LECTURES AS WELL AS BOOKS AVAILABLE, AND WERE
REGARDED AS PROGRESSIVE IN ALL ITS MEANINGS. THIS IS STILL THE AIM OF
LIBRARIES TODAY, BUT SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES HAVE ALWAYS BELONGED TOGETHER AND
INTEGRATION OF THE 2 IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE.

STOCKS, LOANS AND USERS. IN 1980 STOCKS TOTALLED OVER 36 MILLION ITEMS, LOANS
OVER 79 MILLION AND READERS OVER 3 MILLION. DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SLIGHTLY
SLOWER THAN DURING THE PREVIOUS 5 YEARS, PARTLY BECAUSE A HIGH STANDARD HAD
ALREADY BEEN REACHED AND PARTLY BECAUSE MORE ORGANISATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS WERE
REQUIRED. PLANS FOR STOCK EXPANSION HAVE GONE AHEAD BECAUSE THE STATE
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY'S PRODUCTION FIGURES HAVE INCREASED. THE PLANNED TOTAL
STOCK EXPANSION FIGURE HAS BEEN EXCEEDED AND EFFORTS WERE MADE TO KEEP STOCKS

FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY OF REGIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
COMPARED WITH 1939, THERE ARE 4 TIMES AS MANY LIBRARIES IN BULGARIA CATERING
FOR 32 TIMES AS MANY READERS. BOOK COLLECTIONS-ALMOST 83 MILLION VOLUMES AT
PRESENT-HAVE INCREASED 34 TIMES. BULGARIA COMES 5TH IN THE WORLD AS TO THE
NUMBER OF BOOKS PER HEAD OF POPULATION. IN SPITE OF THESE ENCOURAGING
STATISTICS, THE STATE CONTROL COMMITTEE MADE AN INVESTIGATION RECENTLY INTO
THE STRUCTURE, ORGANISATION AND EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN 7 REGIONS.
THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC, SCHOOL AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES VARIED GREATLY.
INHABITANTS ON SOME OF THE NEW HOUSING ESTATES HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED UP TO NOW OF
ANY KIND OF LIBRARY SERVICES. THERE WERE CASES OF HAPHAZARD OPENING AND/OR
CLOSING OF LIBRARIES. THERE IS STILL A LACK OF INFORMATION AND REFERENCE
SERVICES, SHORTAGES IN CONSISTENT CATALOGUING AND PROPER UPKEEP OF RARITIES,
RECOVERY OF OVERDUE BOOKS, AS WELL AS INADEQUATE AUDIO-VISUAL AND REPROGRAPHIC
EQUIPMENT. BETTER PLANNING FOR ACQUISITI ONS, AND ALSO MORE CONSIDERATE
DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE ITEMS ARE MOST DESIRABLE. THE COMMITTEE'S FINDINGS WILL
BE PRESENTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER RELEVANT BODIES WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE
TO TAKE A MUCH MORE ACTIVE INTEREST IN LIBRARIES IN THEIR REGIONS, IN

DISTANCE EDUCATION AND THE CIAE LIBRARY, REPORT ON ONE PLANNING SURVEY.
     
EXTERNAL STUDIES PLACE NEW DEMANDS ON COLLEGE LIBRARIES. IN 1978, CAPRICORNIA
INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION (CIAE) WAS FACED WITH DIFFICULTIES IN COPING
WITH DEMANDS FROM EXTERNAL STUDENTS. THE COLLEGE CARRIED OUT A SURVEY, SENDING
QUESTIONNAIRES TO 40 COLLEGES IN AUSTRALIA; THE RESULTS ARE OUTLINED. MAJOR
CONCLUSIONS WERE THAT SERVICES BY COLLEGE LIBRARIES FOR EXTERNAL STUDENTS WERE
VARIED, AND IN AN EMBRYONIC STAGE, AND THERE WAS URGENT NEED FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS FOR LIBRARY SERVICES TO EXTERNAL STUDENTS. MORE
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARIAN AND EXTERNAL STUDIES DEPARTMENT STAFF WAS
NEEDED. THE CONCLUSIONS ENABLED THE CIAE TO REFINE OBJECTIVES AND TO EXPAND

LACK OF IMMIGRANT LEADERS. THE LIBRARY SCHOOL HAS NOT YET TAKEN THE SUBJECT

IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARY WORK CONCERNING LIBRARY USE ARE' THE
CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL NEEDS; DEVELOPMENT OF AN
AWARENESS OF SOCIAL NEEDS; AND PLANNED STIMULATION OF THE NEED FOR NEW
LITERATURE AND INFORMATION. THE SUBJECT GROUP ON LIBRARY USE SUPPLIES STUDENTS
WITH THE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO USE THE SOCIO-POLITICAL ASPECT OF
ENTIRE LIBRARY ACTIVITY AND ADAPT IT TO MEET THE SOCIAL NEEDS OF THE USER.
LIBRARY USE FALLS UNDER 2 MAIN HEADINGS' USE IN THE LIBRARY ITSELF AND
EXTERNAL USE, THE LENDING SYSTEM. OTHER IMPORTANT FEATURES OF LIBRARY USE ARE'
LIBRARY REGULATIONS FORMING PART OF THE CIVIL LAW; THE LENDING SYSTEM, HOW TO
MAKE IT MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE USER AND USER EDUCATION COURSES WHICH SHOULD BE

READ, WHAT CATEGORIES WORKING CLASS READERS COULD BE DIVIDED INTO AND HOW TO
INFLUENCE AND IMPROVE THEIR READING HABITS. HE ALSO CARRIED OUT AN IMPORTANT
SURVEY ON WOMEN'S READING. RUDOLF ANGERMANN CONTINUED AND EXPANDED HOFMANN'S
WORK. THEY BOTH CONSIDERED THE STIMULI TO READ CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE TO
BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND ANGERMANN FORMULATED A LIST OF DIFFERENT READING
STIMULI. THEY WERE BOTH OF THE OPINION THAT THE LIBRARIAN'S TASK WAS TO ACT AS
ADVISER AND INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE LITERATURE AND THE READER. THEIR AIM WAS
TO OFFER GOOD QUALITY LITERATURE TO LARGE SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE. TODAY
METHODS OF READER RESEARCH CONTINUE TO BE D EVELOPED IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES

METHOD WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE PUPIL'S ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WHICHEVER
METHOD IS USED, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP THE PUPIL'S ABILITY TO READ

MORTENSEN, TO THE MEETING OF THE KOMMUNERNES LANDSFORENING (NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES), WHERE THE QUESTION HAD EARLIER BEEN RAISED
OF HOW CULTURE COULD BE DISSEMINATED TO LARGER CIRCLES. IT WAS ARGUED THAT
EXPANSION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES WAS NOT ENOUGH TO REACH THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH
LIBRARIES. THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK HAD PREVENTED GENUINE DECENTRALISATION
AND POPULARISATION OF CULTURE. LIBRARIES WITH RIGID MANAGEMENT AND DEMAND FOR
QUALIFIED STAFF WERE PREVENTING THEIR USE AS LOCAL CULTURE CENTRES. SOLUTIONS
INVOLVING GREATER COORDINATION WITH OTHER LOCAL ACTIVITIES WERE OFFERED.
AGAINST THIS MORTENSEN ARGUES THAT THE 1964 LIBRARY ACT PROMOTED
DECENTRALISATION AND THAT LIBRARIES MORE THAN OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE REACHING
THE BROAD POPULATION. WARNS AGAINST REDUCTION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IN ORDER
TO HELP THE GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENTS. LOCAL AUT HORITIES NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE
STATE FOR LIBRARY SERVICES. THE DEBATE THAT FOLLOWED AND THE REPLY FROM THE

WAR MOST PEOPLE VISITED THE CINEMA OR THEATRE FOR ENTERTAINMENT, AND TRAVELLED
BY BUS OR TRAIN, NOWADAYS THEY WATCH TELEVISION AT HOME AND TRAVEL BY PRIVATE
CAR. SIMILARLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN USES THE LIBRARY NOT AS
A SUBSTITUTE FOR A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF BOOKS BUT TO SUPPLEMENT HIS OWN
COLLECTION. AS THE ECONOMIC RECESSION DEEPENS THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT THE
GOVERNMENT WILL TURN PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO RECREATIONAL CENTRES AND CREATE NEW

THE FACTS ABOUT CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
IN THE 1978/79 ACADEMIC YEAR STUDENTS OF THE FREDERIK MULLER SCHOOL OF
LIBRARIANSHIP CARRIED OUT A SURVEY INTO CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS. 15 LIBRARIES, VARYING IN SIZE FROM SMALL TOWN TO LARGE CITY
LIBRARIES, WERE SELECTED, 5 IN AREAS WITH A STRONG PROTESTANT LEANING, 5 IN
ROMAN CATHOLIC AREAS AND 5 IN AREAS WITH NO STRONG RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS. THE
RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF CONTROVERSIAL BOOKS STOCKED BY LIBRARIES WAS
IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF THE LIBRARY. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE
ASSURANCES OF ALL LIBRARIANS THAT NO FORM OF CENSORSHIP WAS PRACTISED, FEWER
BOOKS OF A POLITICALLY-CONTROVERSIAL OR PORNOGRAPHIC NATURE WERE TO BE FOUND
IN LIBRARIES IN RELIGIOUS AREAS. IT IS CLEAR THAT CENSORSHIP IS STILL ALIVE IN
THE NETHERLANDS IN 1981 UNDER THE GUISE OF 'REJECTION ON ETHICAL GROUNDS'.

LIBRARY LONG-RANGE PLANNING' A SURVEY OF CURRENT PRACTICES.
     
A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF LIBRARY DIRECTORS IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI REVEALS
THAT APPROXIMATELY 37% CURRENTLY ENGAGE IN LONG-RANGE PLANNING. ANALYSIS OF
THESE PLANS INDICATES THAT THEY ARE MORE OPERATIONS-ORIENTED THAN
STRATEGY-ORIENTED. MOST ARE PREPARED ON AN INFORMAL BASIS BY THE DIRECTORS AND
THEIR STAFFS WITHOUT BENEFIT OF A FORMAL PLANNING METHODOLOGY. A MAJORITY OF
THE LIBRARY DIRECTORS NOT CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN PLANNING EXPRESS A NEED TO DO
SO IN THE FUTURE.

PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS A COMPULSORY PROVISION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
     
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITION OF LOCAL AUTHORITY
CULTURAL SERVICES MUST BE CLARIFIED IN THE 1980S. THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS A
PART OF LOCAL CULTURE THAT CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED AND SO IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR
EACH LIBRARY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER LIBRARIES, CULTURAL ORGANISATIONS AND
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATORS. A DECISION IS NEEDED AS TO WHETHER LOCAL
AUTHORITIES ARE NOT ONLY ENTITLED BUT ALSO OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE CONCEPT OF A NATIONAL LIBRARY LAW SHOULD BE RENOUNCED IN FAVOUR
OF A CONCEPT WHEREBY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IMPOSE ON THEMSELVES THE OBLIGATION TO
PROVIDE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. LOCAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD DRAW UP THEIR OWN LIBRARY
PLANS AND PROVIDE THE MONEY; EACH STATE SHOULD THEN PROVIDE FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE FOR LIBRARY WORK OUTSIDE THESE AREAS.

USERS. WHERE POSSIBLE, ECONOMIES SHOULD BE MADE IN WORKING METHODS RATHER THAN

IT IS USELESS TO ECONOMISE WHEN MONEY IS IN SHORT SUPPLY.
     
THE GERMAN ECONOMY IS ADAPTING WITH DIFFICULTY TO THE RECESSION, TO THE
DETRIMENT OF PUBLIC BUDGETS. CULTURE IS IMPORTANT DURING ECONOMIC CRISES,
THEREFORE CULTURAL BODIES CANNOT RENEGE ON THEIR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
THRIFT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE MOST ECONOMIC PROCEDURE. AN ANALYSIS IS MADE OF
STATISTICS ON LIBRARY EXPENDITURE BY LARGE AND SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN WEST
GERMANY IN 1975-79 TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
STAFFING COSTS AND THE TOTAL BUDGET. A CAREFUL LIBRARY POLICY MUST RECOGNISE
THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF ADAPTING TO THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IN
THE LIGHT OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IF RATIONALISATION METHODS ARE
CARRIED OUT EFFICIENTLY, THE LIBRARY SERVICE CAN ADAPT IN THE RIGHT WAY.

WHEN THE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED IN 1956, AS AN ASSOCIATION OF PARISH

THE ARCHITECT'S VIEW OF MULTI-PURPOSE PLANS.
     
USING LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS FOR OTHER PURPOSES OUTSIDE OPENING HOURS IS A
NATURAL AND GOOD CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DEVELOPING LIAISON WITH OTHER CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES. THE TRADITION OF CHARGING AT MOST A NOMINAL RENT IS LESS
DEFENSIBLE. EXTRA USE INVOLVES UPKEEP AND STAFFING COSTS, AND ORGANISATIONS
MAY RENT UNSUITABLE PREMISES FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. THE DISTRICT CENTRE AT
LYNGEN, NORWAY, HOUSING A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISATIONS AND A POTENTIAL EXAMPLE
OF INTEGRATED ACTIVITY, HAS TO CHARGE A RENT UNACCEPTABLE TO SMALLER GROUPS.
FOR EFFECTIVE USE, ALL CULTURAL PREMISES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME FINANCIAL
STANDING AND JOINT ADMINISTRATION. IN PLANNING OR CONVERSION, THE NEEDS OF
INDIVIDUAL USERS SHOULD BE ANALYSED AND COORDINATED. THE LIBRARIAN, FOR
INSTANCE, SHOULD BE ABLE TO RENT CERTAIN AREAS FULL-TIME (E.G. THE NECESSARY
SPACE FOR STORING EQUIPMENT, SHELVING AND BOOKS) AND OTHER AREAS FOR THE
LIBRARY'S ACTUAL OPENING HOURS, OUTSIDE WHICH THEY COULD BE USED  BY OTHER

EXHIBITIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. NEW POSSIBILITIES OF COOPERATION WITHIN
UNIVERSITIES.
     
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO
MAKE ACADEMIC UNIVERSITY WORK CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE TO THE OUTSIDER. 1 WAY IS
THROUGH WELL-ORGANISED PUBLIC EXHIBITIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. AN
EXHIBITION WHICH WAS ORGANISED BY STUDENTS OF THE HISTORY OF ART DEPARTMENT AT
FREIBERG UNIVERSITY IN JUNE/JULY 80 WAS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF
ACTIVITY. THE STUDENTS ARRANGED CONTACT WITH THE MEDIA, THE ACTUAL EXHIBITION
OBJECTS, CONTACT WITH THE ARTISTS, PUBLICITY, AN OPENING AT WHICH THE ARTISTS
WERE PRESENT, GUIDES TO THE EXHIBITION, WORKSHOPS, TALKS AND PUBLIC
DISCUSSIONS. ALL THE LIBRARY HAD TO DO WAS PROVIDE THE EXHIBITION ROOMS. THE
EXHIBITION WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND ACTED AS A STIMULUS TO OTHER GROUPS
WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY TO ORGANISE SIMILAR EXHIBITIONS TO PRESENT THEIR CURRENT

RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT BY HEURISTIC INFORMATION.
     
AFTER A REVIEW OF HEURISTICS AND HEURISTIC INFORMATION SOME ASPECTS OF MISSION
ORIENTED INFORMATION ARE DEALT WITH FROM THE LIBRARIAN'S VIEWPOINT.
INFORMATION STAFF SHOULD BE AWARE THAT RELEVANT INFORMATION MAY BE LOCATED BY
SEARCHING FIELDS OTHER THAN THE USER'S SPECIALITY. IN ADDITION TO THE
TRADITIONAL SOURCES, AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH ASSISTS IN THE EXPLOITATION
OF SUCH MATERIALS AS REPORTS IN METHODOLOGICAL SURVEYS, RESEARCH REPORTS AND

A GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIALIST AND NON-SPECIALIST QUESTIONS ARE ASKED ABOUT
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, CONCERNING OBJECTIVES, METHODS, RESULTS, ORGANISATION,
POLICIES AND INFORMATION SOURCES. SUCH QUESTIONS CAN BE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED
FOR COMMON DENOMINATORS BUT RECENT WORK BY ANDREWS AND HIS COLLABORATORS
(1979) INDICATES THIS APPROACH TO BE INADEQUATE. USES SIMON'S CONCEPT OF
LIMITED RATIONALITY AS A GENERAL MODEL OF INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATIONAL
OPERATION, WHICH IS APPLIED AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATING
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THE MODEL DOES HELP IN EXPLANATION OF OBSERVATIONS
FREQUENTLY MADE ABOUT RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS' PREFERENCE FOR INFORMAL
INFORMATION SOURCES AND PERSONAL CONTACTS, AND THE FORMATION OF INFORMAL
GROUPS AND NETWORKS. RESEARCHERS AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS WOULD APPEAR TO
FUNCTION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF LIMITED RATIONALITY. THIS MODEL CAN ALSO BE
USED TO PREDICT POTE NTIAL PROBLEMS IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION, SUCH AS THE
CONCEPTION AND USE OF THESAURI AND DATA BANKS. THE QUALITY OF SUCH INFORMATION
SOURCES IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, HENCE THE IMPORTANCE
OF UNDERSTANDING RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR.

ON THE REALISATION OF USER TRAINING FOR STUDENTS AT A COLLEGE OF EDUCATION.
     
THE PROGRESS OF USER TRAINING FOR STUDENTS AT THE ERFURT/MULHAUSEN COLLEGE OF
EDUCATION WAS OUTLINED AT A MEETING OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' STUDY GROUP
AT THE MINISTRY FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION (MINISTERIUM FUR VOLKSBILDUNG) IN JUNE
80. IT HAS PROVED DIFFICULT TO INTEREST ALL THE TEACHERS AT THE COLLEGE IN THE
SUBJECT AND TO IMPRESS ON THEM THE IMPORTANCE OF USER TRAINING TO THE
STUDENTS. IT IS PLANNED TO HOLD MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS TO SHOW TEACHERS
METHODS OF USER TRAINING AND OF PUTTING THE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE TO THE TEST.
STUDENT USER TRAINING CONSISTS OF A TOUR AROUND THE LIBRARY, AND LIBRARY
DEPARTMENTS, LECTURES IN COLLEGE AND AT THE LIBRARY AND PRACTICAL TESTS IN
USING CATALOGUES AND OTHER INFORMATION SOURCES. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED BY THE
STUDENTS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN WORKING INDEPENDENTLY IN THE CATALOGUE SECTION,
USING A WIDER RANGE OF REFERENCE LITERATURE AND PREPARING THEIR FINAL THESIS.

THE ISSUE CONTROL IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS.
     
STATEMENTS BY THE DANISH LIBRARIANS' UNION SHOW THAT LIBRARIANS KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT WORK IN THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS AND ISSUE DESKS, WHERE OFFICE TRAINED
STAFF, NOT LIBRARIANS, WORK; THEY THEREFORE TEND TO REJECT AUTOMATION IN THESE
AREAS. THEY ARE, ON THE OTHER HAND, TRAINED IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICES AND
HENCE APPROVE OF AUTOMATION OF THESE. THE FACT IS, HOWEVER, THAT PRESENT
MANUAL ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING VERY POORLY' BOOKS ARE BEING RECALLED
WHICH ARE ALREADY RETURNED OR HAVE NEVER BEEN BORROWED. REFERS TO A NEGLECTED
REPORT OF 1979 BY A COMMITTEE OF HEADS OF ISSUE DESKS, WHICH RECOMMENDS
EXPERIMENTS WITH AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS AND IN PARTICULAR SUPPORTS AN
AUTOMATIC RECALL SYSTEM. THE ISSUE DESK STAFF OF THE AUTOMATED OLSTYKKE
LIBRARY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED POSITIVE VIEWS ON THEIR AUTOMATIC SYSTEM, VIEWS

ON SOME PROBLEMS OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING AT THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING
LIBRARY.
     
THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING LIBRARY USES A CLASSIFIED CATALOGUE FOR
SUBJECT CATALOGUING WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN 1970. IT IS BASED ON THE
HIERARCHIC UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM OF THE ROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
THIS IS SUITABLE FOR THE STOCK OF THE WISMAR LIBRARY WHICH COVERS A VERY WIDE
RANGE OF SUBJECTS. THE SYSTEMATIC CATALOGUE HAS A FLEXIBLE NOTATION SYSTEM
WHICH CAN COVER COMPLEX TERMS EXTENDING TO 6 COLUMNS AND ALSO HAS KEYWORDS'
GENERAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, CHRONOLOGICAL, LINGUISTIC AND LITERATURE. THE
SYSTEMATICS WORK AT THE WISMAR LIBRARY HAS SEVERAL OBJECTIVES' TO ADAPT THE
ROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION TO THE SPECIALISED
WISMAR COLLECTION; TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM SCIENTIFIC
DEVELOPMENTS BY EXPANDING AND BRINGING UP TO DATE THE SCHEDULES; AND TO WORK
OUT NEW SYSTEMS IN CASES WHERE THE LIMITS OF EXISTING ONES ARE REACHED. WHERE
THIS HAS BEEN NECESSARY 2 C ATALOGUES HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN IN EXISTENCE

NOT INTERESTED IN SPECIALISED VOCABULARY SKILLS. THESE USERS ARE PLACING
DEMANDS THAT WILL REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED INTERNAL TECHNOLOGY, IMPROVED AND

REPORTS FINDINGS RELATED TO ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS' USE OF
ON-LINE DATA BASE SEARCHING AND MICROFICHE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS ON-LINE.
OVERALL, THE DATA SUGGEST THAT DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS ARE INVOLVED IN LITTLE
ON-LINE DATA BASE SEARCHING OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT DATA BASES, HAVE LIMITED
ACCESS TO ON-LINE TERMINALS, HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE TRAINING IN THE USE OF DATA
BASES, AND ACQUIRE VIRTUALLY NO MICROFORMATTED GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS

FEES FOR ONLINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH SERVICES IN PUBLICLY-SUPPORTED LIBRARIES.
     
ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHING IS AN IMPORTANT RECENT INNOVATION IN LIBRARY
SERVICES. THE CHOICES THAT LIBRARIES HAVE MADE IN ADOPTING THIS SERVICE HAVE
IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE LIBRARY SERVICES. THEIR DECISIONS ABOUT
WHETHER, WHEN, AND HOW TO CHARGE THE USER REVEAL THEIR JUDGEMENTS ABOUT THE
APPROPRIATE ROLE OF USER FEES. THE WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES HAVE INTEGRATED
ON-LINE SEARCHING INTO MORE TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR
FUTURE TECHNOLOGY-BASED INNOVATIONS. A CALIFORNIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION SURVEY
OF PUBLICLY-SUPPORTED LIBRARIES FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OFFERING SEARCHES, NEARLY
HALF AT NO CHARGE TO THE USERS; AND THAT USER FEES DIFFERED ACCORDING TO WHERE
THE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED AND WHETHER THE USER OR THE LIBRARIAN WAS SEEN AS ITS
PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES APPEARED TO HAVE 2

LIBRARY SCIENCE AND HISTORY' A DIALECTICAL APPROACH.
     
CRITICISES CONVENTIONAL STUDIES OF LIBRARY HISTORY FOR FAILING TO APPRECIATE
THAT LIBRARIES ARE ESSENTIALLY PART OF AN INTERLOCKING COMPLEX OF INSTITUTIONS
FORMING A PARTICULAR SOCIAL STRUCTURE, WHICH ITSELF IS DETERMINED BY THE

AUSTRIA.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN
A COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,
20-22 MAR 79. AFTER A SHORT OUTLINE OF THE PRE-1978 AUSTRIAN LIBRARY
EDUCATION, CONCENTRATES ON THE DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW SYSTEM IN OPERATION FROM
1979. TRAINING IN LIBRARIANSHIP, DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS NOT
PROVIDED BY ANY ACADEMIC INSTITUTION IN AUSTRIA AND IS THEREFORE CARRIED OUT
BY LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES. LIBRARY EDUCATION IS DIVIDED INTO
CATEGORIES A, B, AND C ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL OF GENERAL EDUCATION OF
STUDENTS. A-UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, B-SECONDARY SCHOOL CERTIFICATES,
C-UNCERTIFIED SECONDARY SCHOOL LEAVERS. 5 MAIN DISCIPLINES TAUGHT ARE' LAW,
LIBRARY ORGANISATION, HISTORICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS,
PROCESSING, AND THE STORAGE AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION.

INTRODUCTION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. THE PRESENT CONTENT,
LEVEL AND FRAMEWORK OF HUNGARIAN LIBRARY TRAINING IS UNSATISFACTORY'
CURRICULUM UNITS ARE NOT BUILT UPON EACH OTHER; THE SUBJECTS STUDIED ARE NOT
SEPARATED ENOUGH ON EACH LEVEL AND ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COORDINATED; AND THE
COMBINATION OF SUBJECTS DOES NOT REFLECT THE DEMANDS MADE ON LIBRARIES. THE
NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO GO ON TO WORK IN LIBRARIES IS NOT KNOWN. THE
AUTHORITIES HAVE ASKED FOR SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING EDUCATION FOR
LIBRARIANSHIP.

SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIAN? LIBRARY SCIENTIST? SCIENTIFICALLY TRAINED LIBRARIAN? OR
DEVELOPING TRAINING DEMANDS OF A DEVELOPING PROFESSION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LASZLO MATRAI HAS
SUGGESTED THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT A LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE A
SCIENTIST OF THE SUBJECT FIELD CARED FOR AND SERVED BY HIM, BUT BY NO MEANS A
LIBRARY SCIENTIST. THUS LIBRARY SKILLS SHOULD BE ATTAINED BY PRACTICE. THE
AUTHOR FEELS THAT THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION IN A LIBRARY IS A COMPLEX
OPERATION, REQUIRING TRAINING AT A HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL. THIS TRAINING,
INCORPORATING UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE, IS THE ESSENCE OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION
AND IS ESSENTIAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS.

SOME QUESTIONS OF LIBRARY TRAINING, RELATION OF UNIVERSITY AND HIGH SCHOOL
TRAINING.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LIBRARY TRAINING SHOULD
BE BASED ON THE PROFESSION AND NOT ON THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES. GENERAL
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING SHOULD BE OFFERED RATHER THAN SPECIALIST TRAINING. THE
SUBJECTS COVERED SHOULD BE LINKED WITH EACH OTHER AND THE PROFESSION'S
OBJECTIVES. HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY TRAINING SHOULD BE SEPARATE, BUT
CONNECTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT CROSSING FROM 1 TO THE OTHER IS MADE EASIER.

NEW TRENDS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE STUDIES.
     
THE DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AT THE FACULTY OF
PHILOSOPHY WITHIN THE COMENIUS UNIVERSITY IN BRATISLAVA HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE
FOR 30 YEARS. AT PRESENT, BOTH FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME UNDERGRADUATE AND
POSTGRADUATE COURSES ARE OFFERED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW IDEAS IN THE
CZECHOSLOVAK SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION, CURRICULA HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUBJECTED
TO PROFOUND AND SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES. THE DURATION OF UNDERGRADUATE
COURSES HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 5 TO 4 YEARS. IT WILL CONCENTRATE ON
LIBRARIANSHIP AND/OR INFORMATION SCIENCE AS WELL AS ON CLOSELY RELATED
SUBJECTS. THE AIM OF EQUIPPING STUDENTS WITH THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD
OF THEIR PROSPECTIVE TYPE OF LIBRARY HAS BEEN ABANDONED. ALTHOUGH IT FELL
SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS, THE EXTENSION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUILDING WILL
NEVERTHELESS ENABLE THE TEACHING AND OTHER STAFF TO BUILD UP RESOURCES OF
AUDIO-VISUAL AIDS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS,  AND ALSO TO INVOLVE THEIR
STUDENTS IN RESEARCH PROJECTS.

NEW ERA OF THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA.
     
THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA WAS FOUNDED IN 1953, SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH SIMILAR SCHOOLS IN PRAGUE AND BRNO. AFTER OVERCOMING CONSIDERABLE
DIFFICULTIES OF VARIOUS KINDS IN THE 1ST 10 YEARS OF ITS HISTORY, THE SCHOOL
HAS CONCENTRATED IN EDUCATING AND TRAINING PROSPECTIVE NON-GRADUATE LIBRARIANS
AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS. SO FAR ABOUT 3,000 STUDENTS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR
FULL-TIME OR PART-TIME COURSES. ALMOST 90% OF THEM WORK IN LIBRARIES AND IN
CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION. COMMENCING IN THE
ACADEMIC YEAR 1984-85, NEW SYLLABUSES WILL COME INTO FORCE. THE COURSES
OFFERED WILL BE FULL-TIME ONLY. AFTER 2 YEARS WITH A COMMON CURRICULUM,
STUDENTS WILL TAKE UP EITHER LIBRARIANSHIP OR INFORMATION SCIENCE FOR THE
REMAINING 2 YEARS, WHEN FINAL EXAMINATIONS OF A THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL
NATURE WILL BE HELD. THE NEW PROJECT, WORKED OUT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE
RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND  TRAINING IN PRAGUE, WILL
BECOME A FURTHER STEP TOWARDS PROVIDING LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES WITH
CAPABLE STAFF.

QUALIFICATION OF LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS.
     
HAVING MENTIONED BRIEFLY THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES TO SOCIETY, AND ALSO
COURSES OFFERED FOR PROSPECTIVE NON-GRADUATE AND GRADUATE LIBRARIANS AND
INFORMATION SCIENTISTS IN SLOVAKIA, DISCUSSES CONTINUING EDUCATION AND
IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE STAFF. SINCE 1976, THE
SAID CONCEPT HAS ENJOYED OFFICIAL BACKING BY REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE SLOVAK
MINISTRY OF CULTURE. THE REGULATIONS ARE BINDING ON ALL CENTRAL AND OTHER
MAJOR LIBRARIES. SO FAR, THE MOST IMPORTANT TRAINING PROJECTS HAVE BEEN
LAUNCHED BY MATICA SLOVENSKA AND BY THE SLOVAK TECHNICAL LIBRARY. IN-SERVICE
COURSES SHOULD NOT ONLY INCLUDE LECTURES, BUT ALSO WORK IN SEMINARS AND
SMALLER GROUPS. VISITS TO SELECTED LIBRARIES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR STAFF
STIMULATE THE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND IDEAS. FILMS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVE
MATERIALS MUST BE USED MORE FULLY. GRADUATES, CONTINUING THEIR STUDIES ABROAD,
MUST BE ENCOURAGED TO CONCENTRATE ON TOPICAL PROBLE MS, AND TO AIM AT POSTS
WITH RESPONSIBILITY. USERS OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE TO BE
EDUCATED AND TRAINED, TOO, TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE.
STARTING WITH UNDERGRADUATES, THE SCHEME MUST BE EXPANDED TO INVOLVE THE WHOLE
NATION IN FUTURE.

CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS THROUGH PRIVATE STUDY.
     
REPORT ON A 2-YEAR-SCHEME INTRODUCED BY THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARY IN RUSE,
TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS IN THE REGION THROUGH PRIVATE
STUDY. INITIALLY, 75 TOPICS WERE OFFERED, AND 94% OF FULL-TIME LIBRARIANS TOOK
PART IN THE SCHEME. EVEN PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS WITH 10, 15 AND MORE YEARS OF
SERVICE WERE NOT EXCLUDED FROM THEORETICAL, CONTROVERSIAL AND/OR INNOVATIVE
THEMES. THEY ALSO WIDELY EXPLORED SOVIET PERIODICALS AND LITERATURE IN
RUSSIAN. THE ATTITUDE AND RESPONSE OF BEGINNERS AND SOME LIBRARY ASSISTANTS
APPEARED TO BE LESS ENTERPRISING AND ENTHUSIASTIC, IN SOME CASES EVEN FORMAL.
IT IS HOPED, HOWEVER, THAT THEIR PROFESSIONAL ETHICS WILL IMPROVE IN FUTURE.
REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEIR TUTORS, RESULTING IN THE INEVITABLE EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS AND OPINIONS WERE OF BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE IN THE STUDY. A POSITIVE
EVALUATION OF THE SCHEME MUST BE FOLLOWED BY FURTHER EXPERIMENTATION,
SEARCHING AND STRIVING FOR IMPROVE MENT.

THE LIBRARIANS' UNION AND FUTURE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
A GROUP OF STUDENTS AT THE DANISH LIBRARY SCHOOL CRITICISES THE LIBRARIANS'
UNION FOR LACK OF POLICY ON EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, WHICH IS THE SUBJECT
OF A COMMITTEE OF THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, AND URGES IT TO INITIATE A DEBATE
AMONG THE MEMBERS. THE GROUP PRESENTS ITS OWN SUGGESTIONS' MINOR SUBJECTS
SHOULD BE GATHERED IN LARGER SUBJECT GROUPS; ACCOUNT SHOULD BE TAKEN IN
TEACHING OF THE TREND TO LIBRARIES STAFFED BY A SINGLE LIBRARIAN; THE USE OF
COMPUTERS SHOULD NOT BE A SUBJECT ON ITS OWN, BUT TAUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH
ALL SUBJECT AREAS; TEACHING OF RUSSIAN COULD BE CONFINED TO TEACHING OF
TRANSLITERATION UNDER CATALOGUING; THE TEACHING OF LITERATURE AND INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL SHOULD GIVE A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR SEARCHING WITHIN ANY SUBJECT
AREA AND NOT AIM TO GIVE THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULAR SUBJECTS; AND THE
NEW UNIFIED COURSE SHOULD NOT INCLUDE SPECIALISATION, BUT EMPHASISE THE COMMON
ASPECTS OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARI ANSHIP.

ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES, 1937 TO PRESENT.
     
FROM ALMOST ITS INCEPTION IN 1937, ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING HAS BEEN
PRIMARILY A POST-EMPLOYMENT EFFORT. THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INDIFFERENCE OF
THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN BOTH THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND HISTORY,
THE 2 MAIN DISCIPLINES FROM WHICH MANUSCRIPT LIBRARIANS AND ARCHIVISTS ARE
DRAWN. BETWEEN 1937-40 AND 1967-70, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BECAME
PERIPHERALLY INTERESTED. THE HISTORY PROFESSION HAS BECOME MORE ACTIVE SINCE
THE EARLY 1970S IN ITS SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE CAREERS FOR ASPIRING HISTORIANS.
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY SCHOOLS ALSO HAVE BEEN OFFERING ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT COURSES
SINCE THE EARLY 1960S PARTICULARLY. BY LACKING ACADEMIC STATUS, THE AMERICAN
LITERATURE IN THE ARCHIVAL FIELD HAS ALSO BEEN UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THIS HAS
CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOWNESS IN DEVELOPING ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL CONTROL OF
ARCHIVAL/MANUSCRIPT SOURCES. AN ATTEMPT IN 1967-70 TO DEVELOP AN ARCHIVAL
MANUAL WITHI N A.L.A. DIED ABORNING AND THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS AND
SOCIETY OF AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS HAVE JUST BEGUN TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEM
INDEPENDENTLY. PRACTICING ARCHIVISTS OF NECESSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN
TEACHER POOL AND CONTRIBUTORS TO THE LITERATURE UNTIL REGULAR FACULTY IN
LIBRARY SCHOOLS AND HISTORY DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY TRAINED, BUT 1ST
A BASIC REORIENTATION MUST OCCUR THAT RECOGNISES THAT RECORDS AND PAPERS OF
CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY ARE THE CENTRAL PROBLEM.

BEGINNING WITH A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF 24 PUBLISHED SURVEYS AND PROGRAMMES OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE CURRICULA FROM 1969-75, DISCUSSES THE
PROFESSIONAL CONTINUITY IN CHANGING COURSES. A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IS
MAINTAINING THE IDENTITY OF 'CORE STUDIES' IN PROFESSIONAL CURRICULA. THE
CONTENT AND OBJECTIVES OF COMPUTER COURSES ARE LISTED AND DISCUSSED. THE
COVERAGE OF THE AUTHOR'S OWN SURVEY IS EXPLAINED. ALL 17 SCHOOLS IN THE UK, 1
IN DUBLIN AND 13 IN EASTERN USA AND CANADA WERE VISITED IN 1978 INVOLVING
INTERVIEWS WITH OVER 130 PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY OR IN GROUPS. 10 SCHOOLS OVERSEAS
PROVIDED FURTHER DATA IN QUESTIONNAIRES. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY BEGIN BY

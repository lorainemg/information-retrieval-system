18 Editions of the Dewey Decimal Classifications
.A
Comaromi, J.P.
.W
   The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal
Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published
in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions
will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's
long and healthy life, however, its full story has never
been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey
that briefly describe his system, but this is the first
attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that
more than any other has spurred the growth of
librarianship in this country and abroad.

Use Made of Technical Libraries
.A 
Slater, M.
.W
This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use
in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom.
Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of
information use.  Information transfer in libraries is
restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no
account of documents used outside the library, still
less of information transferred orally from person
to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a
proportion of the situations in which information is
transferred.
Taking technical information transfer as a whole,
there is no doubt that this proportion is not the
major one.  There are users of technical information -
particularly in technology rather than science -
who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk
collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal
contact with their colleagues and with people in other
organizations.  Even regular library users also receive
information in other ways.

Two Kinds of Power
An Essay on Bibliographic Control
.A
Wilson, P.
.W
    The relationships between the organization and control of writings
and the organization and control of knowledge and information will
inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a
great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical
control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power,
as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense
power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written
form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of
knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as
simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings.

Systems Analysis of a University Library; 
final report and research project
.A
Buckland, M.K.
.W
    The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly 
stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic
libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but
although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective
information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university.
The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which,
in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into
all aspects of academic library provision.

A Library Management Game:
a report on a research project
.A
Brophy, P.
.W
    Although the use of games in professional education has
become widespread only during the last decade, the method has
been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years.
Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in
military training when the "real thing" was either unavailable
or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have
become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large
electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved.
Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was
introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety
of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education,
from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional
men and women.  One of the main causes of this "game explosion"
has been the rapid development of sophisticated management
techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which
have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.

Abstracting Concepts and Methods
.A
Borko, H.
.W
     Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a 
how-to-do-it course.
It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts,
the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing
industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the
preparation and evaluation of the product.
These topics we call concepts.
     The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing
various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications.
These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the
appendix.
There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications.
     Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we
believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the
past.
Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship.
Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of
computer-prepared abstracts and extracts.
Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this
research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text,
select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts.
The benefits of this research are discussed.
    Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry.
Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or
volunteer workers.
Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know
they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information.
One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors.

Academic Library Buildings
A Guide to Architectural Issues and Solutions

This book attempts to present representative examples of successful
architectural solutions to the important problems librarians and
architects face in planning new college and university library
buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It does
not attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done by
Ellsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examples
of unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes,
and in these cases the libraries will not be identified.

The Academic Library Essays in Honor of Guy R. Lyle
.A
Farber, E.I.
.W
     As important for staff members' individual development
as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most
significant attitude one acquired while working for
Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must
be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the
materials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his
respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and
reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in
his admonition that, though we were primarily a research
library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to
collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It
was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be
responsible for these as well as for "general" books which crossed
disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books
which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is
apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection,
"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with
books through a reading of critical reviews and the books
themselves."  This counsel is from The President, the Professor,
and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the
need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was
continually impressed upon us.

Access to Libraries in College
.A
Hyman, R.T.
.W
     This study assumed that an additional use study held
less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts.
The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and
current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering
instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire.
     Findings of the documentary analysis included the following:
     Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach
and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and
evidently resistant to established methods of use and user
research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was
confirmed.
     Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification
and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual,
social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect
his democratic self-realization.
     Definitions of "browsing" varied greatly: self-indulgence
by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education
for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his
research.

Access to Periodical Resources
.A
Palmour, V.E.
.W
          The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate,
and recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical
resources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans
are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being
satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in
the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is
the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring,
storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials.
          This study focused on the physical access to the
periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community,
design features were developed, and included the following:
          Service should be made available to all users
          without any restriction other than access
          through a library.
          Initially, the service should be confined primarily
          to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of
          journal articles.
          The collection of a center should be comprehensive
          in subject coverage excluding only medicine.
          All worthwhile journals should be collected
          irrespective of language.

The Acquisition of Library Materials

Ford, S.
.W
  The scope of acquisitions work, outlined in the Introduction,
acknowledges the importance of selection policy,
serials recording, and other topics kindred to acquisitions.
These topics are discussed in this book only as they relate
to obtaining library materials.  They are examined thoroughly
in books and papers that are cited in the references and the
bibliographic note.
  Centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of
major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in
this book.  These chapters are introductions to the concepts and
problems of centralization and automation, not manuals of practice.
For treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is
referred to the references cited.  For automation these references
are only a modest selection from an enormous literature.

Acquisition from the 3rd World
.A
Clarke, D.A.
.W
  The Ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche (LIBER) was set up
in 1971 as an international non-governmental organization, with the aim of
establishing close collaboration between the general research libraries of
Western Europe, particularly national and university libraries, and in
particular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality of
the services these libraries provide.
  At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972,
LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the
'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this
seminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of
acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for
reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre
for the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision
of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be
a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications
from those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the
cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19
September 1973.

The Administration of the College Library
.A
Lyle, G.R.
.W
  If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple but
frequently neglected principle that college library service goes
beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and
storage.  The college library exists, not merely to house and
circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching
process with reference service, to afford faculty members library
opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students
to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a
service activity, a tool through which library functions are more
fully and efficiently realized.
  The present work retains most of the material of the first edition,
but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was
planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library
administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because
readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful
for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in
some cases extended.

technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the 
interaction of both social relations and work structure.. The sociometric 
"stars" in the technical communication network who provide other members of the
organization with information either make greater use of individuals outside
the organization or read the literature more than other members of the 
laboratory..

Adopting the Library of Congress Classification System
.A
Matthis, R.E.
.W
     This manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change
efficiently to the Library of Congress Classification system.  Detailed
procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of
suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use.  Most of the text
deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the
preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which
are essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable
attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC
Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In
addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most
frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been
thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of
comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of
catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users,
a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying
machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography
of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is
included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the
tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized
cataloging and classification.  The numbers enclosed in parentheses
throughout the text refer to sources in the bibliography which relate
to or support the arguments being advanced in any particular case.

Adventures in Librarianship
.A
Voigt, M.J.
.B
1970
.W
  There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide
scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of
librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular
current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of
the advances made through research and practice.  Advances in
Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will
present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature,
research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types.
   Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts
of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all
librarians who can visualize its potential.
Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series.
As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change
has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been
found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts
expected.
Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of
automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope
to get there.
"The Machine and Cataloging" reviews the current status of the machine-produced
book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC.
Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as
reported in "Mechanization of Acquisition Processes."
Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the
future, not the past.
One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of
catalog information is that discussed in "Filing Systems for Computer
Manipulation."
This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests
possible solutions.
   For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate
knowledge of the facts.
As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of
traditional operations become essential.
The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult
and reviews the significant advances of the past few years.
   The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much
more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the
instructional media center.
Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible
major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in
the public library.
Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that
what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception.
   Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow.
   Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial
planning theory have for libraries.
The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in
administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some.
   The article on library development in developing countries provides an
analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other
countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern
world.

Selective Dissemination of Information
.A
Mauerhoff, G.R.
.B
1974
.W
  The present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but
complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that
exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971.  Additionally,
it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history
of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as
reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn
(1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing
ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review
therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation,
and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies,
government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the
last fourteen years.

Adventures in Theory of Languages
.A
Herdan, G.
.W
  In trying to give an account of the statistical properties of
language, one is faced with the problem of having to find the
common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms
of language statistics - embodied in scattered papers written
by linguists, philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, each using
his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole:
quantitative linguistics.
  The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language
structure as against just conventional statistics.  To put the
difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises
the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in
Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising
parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language
structure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and
methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's "Language as
choice and Chance", 1956, has now taken definite shape.
  Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book,
"Language as Choice and Chance", the foundation was laid for a truly
sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation
of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical
universe and sample.

The Age of Jewett: Charles Coffin Jewett and American Librarianship
1841-1868
.A
Harris, M.M.
.W
     Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship
from the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and
the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and
controversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter.
     But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in
the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the
1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances
in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to
have considerable influence on the course of library development in
America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth
century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era,
and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate
and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding
of the American Library Association.

On Aggression
.A
Lorenz, K.
.W
  In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression
in vertebrates.  He points out that aggressivity is totally different
from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of
territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed
up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction
of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in
fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack
is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting
is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially
peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often
fatal attacks on the weaker mate.
  In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in
the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and
not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the
aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels.
Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior,
many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in
animals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by
a master of his subject.

Education and Manpower for Librarians
.A
Asheim, L.E.
.W
  This paper is not an official policy statement
of the American Library Association nor
of the Office for Library Education.  It is
simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities
for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is 
to generate discussion that will lead
eventually to a statement of Association policy
that the profession will support and make
effective.
  A basic assumption on which the statement
rests is this: that the library occupation is
much broader than that segment of it which is
the library profession, but that the professional
segment has responsibility for the definition
and supervision of the training and education
required by the complete range of activities
encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians
are not the only persons who work in
libraries, but librarians are the ones who are
concerned with the advancement and improvement
of the library profession.  It follows then
that it is the obligation of the professionals
to engage actively in the establishment and
maintenance of standards and norms governing
the preparation of people who work at
any level in libraries.  They should define and
guide the kinds of preparation most useful at
the pre-professional level and not
merely the education of those who will hold
positions at the level we now call "professional."

staff regarding the extent of the problem of
missing books.  The findings of this study gave
the Ohio State University libraries concrete
evidence as to how many books are missing
and indicated the areas in which book losses
are the greatest.  These figures also provide
information which can be conveyed to the
faculty or administration when they voice

Algebraic Systems
.A
Maltsev, A.I.
.W
   As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science
studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular
system of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelming
majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic
structures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first
general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary
operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A.
Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic
principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such
sets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made
abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of
making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but
also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was
discovered by the author in 1936.
  During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the
theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately
related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And
it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems
dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and
relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the
language of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can
be considered to border on logic and algebra.

Indexing and Abstracting by Association

Doyle, L.B.
.W
This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the
statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of
document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related
to the mental processes of authors and readers; several
means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence
are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most
strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore
"associated" in a statistical sense, can be represented
in the form of an "association map."  The last half of the
article presents two modes of use of association maps
in literature searching.

Cost Analysis and Simulation Procedures for the Evaluation
of Large Information Systems
.A
Bourne, C.P.
Ford, D.F.
.W
A computer program has been written and used which
simulates the several-year operation of an information
system and computes estimates of the expected
operating costs as well as the amount of equipment
and personnel required during that time period.  The
program has been used for the analysis of several
large systems and has proven itself to be a useful
research tool for the study of systems with so many
components and interrelated operations that an
equivalent manual analysis would be extremely
cumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even
impractical. This paper describes this program and
shows, as an example, some of the results of a simulation
of two of several suggested designs for a specific
information system.

A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance
.A
Taube, M.
.W
  Recently a number of articles, books, and reports
dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval
systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems
are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage
of relevancy they provide.
  Although there seems to be little agreement on what
relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable,
there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed
and formal relationship exists between the relevance and
the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find
in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of 
relevance as reported by individual users, and equations,
curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide
numerical measures of the recall and relevance
characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon
of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective
and non-mathematical term to equations in which the
same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical
definition has its ancient parallel in discussions
of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the
meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out,
on "who is master," the user or the term.  On the other hand,
the use of a single term in the same document to cover
two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a
usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine
by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does
not have, represents a more serious situation than merely
careless ambiguity.

Some Questions Concerning "Information Need"
.A
O'Connor, J.
.W
The expression "satisfying a requester's information
need" is often used, but its meaning is obscure.  The
literature on "information need" in relation to
retrieval suggests three different (though not inconsistent)
possible interpretations.  However, each of these
interpretations is itself fundamentally unclear. The
various obscurities involved are indicated by critical
questions, which those who write of information need
are invited to answer.

Vocabulary Building and Control Techniques
.A
Wall, Eugene
.W
   The rationale is given for creation and maintainance by an information 
center of a controlled indexing and retrieval vocabulary.. Basic vocabulary
principles are (1) use of natural language, (2) development of hospitality
to new concepts, (3) provision of adequate cross-referencing, and (4)
formatting for easy use.. Terminalogical conventions necessary for development
and control of a useful vocabulary are summarized, and the techniques for 
applying these conventions to construct a thesaurus are described.. 
Computerized editing techniques and updating techniques are briefly set forth..

Attendance and Use of the Science Library at M.I.T.
.A
Bush, G.C.
Galliher, H.P.
Morse, P.M.
.W
This is an interim report on continuing
studies of library operations at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology being made by
members of the Institute's Operations Research
Project in cooperation with the librarians and
library staff.  In this report, which is based
on actual observations of on-the-premise use
made of the Science Library, various statistics
measuring the kind, degree, and intensity of use
are tabulated.  In addition there are some
suggested measures of effectiveness of the library.
A unique outcome of the survey has been the
construction and verification of a mathematical
model employing probability theory to measure
rate and kind of use of library material
together with length of stay of library patrons.
Such models, characteristic of an operations
research approach, give promise of furthering
the goal of effective library management and
planning.

Information Gathering Patterns and Creativity
A study of research chemists in an industrial research laboratory
.A
Maizell, Robert E.
.W
   A comparison of creative and "noncreative" research chemists with 
respect to the ways in which they use their professional and technical 
literature.. The creative chemists differ from the "noncreative" in that the
former read more technical literature on the job, are less reluctant to use 
literature of greater reading difficulty, are less influenced in their 
independence of thought, read more extensively and consult more frequently the
older material, are more inquisitive and have broader cultural interests.. The
findings of the study are believed to be helpful in planning library and 
information services, in refining future inquiries into the ways in which
scientists use recorded information, and in improving tests for the 
identification of creative ability among chemists..

Keyword-In-Context Index for Technical Literature (KWIC Index)
.A
Luhn, H.P.
.W
   A distinction is made between bibliographical indexes for new and past
literature based on the willingness of the user to trade perfection for 
currency.. Indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable 
for disseminating new information.. These can be entirely machine-generated 
and hence kept up-to-date with the current literature.. A compatible coding 
scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed.. In it elements are
automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the 
coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible 
to normal methods of ordering..

Savage, T.R.
.W
An experiment was conducted to determine which of 
four types of lexical indicators of content could be
utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from
irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100
questions.  The results indicate that there were no
major differences between the groups using complete
text and abstracts to select relevant documents, but
the group utilizing the complete text obtained a
significantly higher score on the examination.

The World's Technical Journal Literature:
An Estimate of Volume, Origin, Language,
Field, Indexing, and Abstracting
.A 
Bourne, C.P.
.W
A quantitative estimate is made of the magnitude of the
world's scientific and technical journal literature problem.
Using a number of basic sources of statistical information,
a composite picture is established to show such things as
the total volume, linguistic and national origins, breakdown
by subject field, and degree of coverage by the abstracting
and indexing services.

Machinelike Indexing by People
.A
Montgomery, C.
Swanson, D.R.
.W
A study of several thousand entries in a classified bibliography
of article titles (the Index Medicus) revealed that a
large proportion of the title entries contained words identical
to or synonymous with words of the corresponding
subject heading.  It is inferred that a major part of the
bibliography studied could have been compiled by a machine
procedure operating on titles alone, provided the
machine was supplied with a suitable synonym dictionary.

Kessler, M.M.
.W
This report describes the results of automatic processing
of a large number of scientific papers according
to a rigorously defined criterion of coupling.  The
population of papers under study was ordered into 
groups that satisfy the stated criterion of interrelation.
An examination of the papers that constitute the
groups shows a high degree of logical correlation.

   Results of the census of the world's scientific and technical serial 
literature, within the limits defined and based on an examination of published 
source material from countries throughout the world, reflect a total title 
population much lower than estimated before.. Distribution of this population 
by country, showing better than 50% of the total divided among six major 
countries,  is included and discussed, together with a broad subject 
distribution of serials for certain countries..

New Factors in the Evaluation of Scientific Literature 
Through Citation Indexing
.A
Garfield, E.

Sher, I.H.
.W
   More than one million citations from the scientific literature have been 
processed by the Citation Index Project at the Institute for Scientific 
Information.. The Project, sponsored by NSF and NIH, will be described briefly,
and new methods of using citation data for evaluation of publications will be
discussed..
   Summaries of statistical data, compiled by computer methods such as the 
following, will be given..
   1. Frequency of citation of one journal by another..
   2. Frequency of current citations to the past literature..
   3. Frequency of self-citation by journals and authors..
   4. Number of source citations per cited paper..
   5. Number of references per source paper..
   6. Number of papers published per journal..

The Notion of Relevance
.A
Hillman, Donald J.
.W
   Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and 
document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of
conceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question 
of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of
concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is 
associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity-
judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and
conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general 
difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their 
relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human 
relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has
serious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is 
therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article..

The Consistency of Human Judgments of Relevance
.A
Resnick, A.
.A
Savage, T.R.
.W
   A comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance 
of documents to their general interests from bases of citations, abstracts, 
keywords, and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions.. 
The results showed that 1) humans are able to make such judgments consistently,
and 2) the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base 
from which it is made.. Apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the 
basis of abstracts remains unexplained.. This experiment, as well as others
concerned with human evaluations of text material, leave unexplored the basic
problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured..

The Distribution of Term Usage in Manipulative Indexes
.A
Houston, Nona
.A
Wall, Eugene
.W
   A semi-empirical correlation, based on data from nine indexes, permits the
prediction of the percentage of terms in a manipulative index vocabulary which 
will be used to index any given number of documents.. This is a function of the
total number of index entries in the system.. A log-normal relationship, 
similar  to Zipf's Law, exists between total index entries and distribution of
term usage.. Based upon the correlation, optimum vocabulary size and growth rate
can inferred, as well as the most efficient arrangement of index entries in a 
storage medium.. The results agree well with published data and appear to be 
particularly useful for designers of mechanized retrieval or publication
operations..

Measuring the Reliability of Subject Classification by Men and Machines
.A
Borko, Harold
.W
   Procedures for measuring the consistency of document classification are 
described.. Three subject specialists classified 997 abstracts of psychological 
reports into one of eleven categories.. These abstracts were also mechanically
classified by a computer program using a factor score computational procedure.. 
Each abstract was scored for all categories and assigned to the one with the
highest score.. The three manual classifications were compared with each other
and with the mechanical classifications, and a series of contingency 
coefficients was computed.. The average reliability of manual classification 
procedures was equal to .870.. The correlation between automatic and manual 
classification was .766..

A Quantitative Measure of User Circulation Requirements and Its Possible
Effect on Stack Thinning and Multiple Copy Determination
.A
Trueswell, Richard W.
.W
   The strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the 
librarian for thinning a library's stack according to the criterion of user 
needs.. The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user 
circulation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design,
satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of
minimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates 
that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 
percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may
also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order
that user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this 
approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the 
library's holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the 
disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of 
use by another..

Improvement of the Selectivity of Citation Indexes to Science Literature
Through Inclusion of Citation Relationship Indicators
.A
Lipetz, Ben-Ami
.W
   Citation indexes to large bodies of science literature can often list far
more citing references under the known cited reference than the user can 
afford the time to look up.. By providing some additional information, beyond 
the minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference, a 
citation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long list 
those citing references which are most relevant to his immediate search 
requirement.. Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particular 
attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation 
entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication
is operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral feature 
of the Shepard's legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships of 
potential value to users of science literature is presented.. These 
relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature.. The suggested 
categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the
scientific process in general, as well as indicators of its relationship to the
cited reference in particular.. Assignment of the categories to a citation 
requires the exercise of judgment, as in subject indexing, but does not involve
the use of subject terminology.. An illustration is provided of the application 
from a citation index to physics literature..

The Norms of Citation Behavior: Prolegomena to the Footnote
.A
Kaplan, Norman
.W
   The publication explosion has focused renewed attention on the lowly 
footnote.. While we are all at least partially aware of the technical functions
of the citation for both the writer and the reader of the scientific paper, 
little is known about the norms operating in actual practice.. Even less is 
known about the operating norms with respect to the more sociological functions,
including the acknowledgement of intellectual debts or the conferral of 
recognition upon the works of others.. This paper reviews the state of our 
knowledge, raises questions, and proposes suggestions and hypotheses for 
studying the relationships between footnoting practices among scientists and
the social system of science..

Adaptive Information Dissemination
.A
Sage, C.R.
.A
Anderson, R.R.
.A
Fitzwater, D.R.
.W
   Computer dissemination of information offers significant advantages over
manual dissemination because the computer can use strategies that are 
impractical and in some cases impossible for a human.. This paper describes
the Ames Laboratory Selective Dissemination of Information system with emphasis
on the effectiveness of user feedback.. The system will accept any document, 
abstract, keyword, etc., in a KWIC or Science Citation Index Source format..
User profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially 
assigned significance value.. These values are used in making the decision to
notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document.. According to
responses, the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly 
attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the user's interests.. The
system is economical compared to other existing SDI systems and human
intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries..

An Experiment in Automatic Indexing
.A
Damerau, Fred J.
.W
   This report describes a method of indexing documents which is based on the 
assumptions, (1) that a subset of the words in a document can be an effective 
index to that document, and (2) that this subject can be approximated by 
selecting those words from the document whose frequencies are statistically
unexpectedly high.. The results of the experiment are encouraging, although not
definitive because any index set chosen must be tested by using it for 
retrieval from a large collection..

Comparative Indexing: Terms Supplied by Biomedical 
Authors and by Document Titles
.A
Schultz, Claire K.
.A
Schultz, Wallace L.
.A
Orr, Richard H.
.W
   The original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the 
much argued question of whether author indexing is "good".. Author indexing of
285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author-
supplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms that 
was  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the same
document.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. The
average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than 
one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as 
compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and 
criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing 
derived from document titles.. The findings suggest that indicia supplied by an
author should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own 
about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues.. The general method
developed for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of 
wide applicability..

.W
   This paper defines and describes the KWIC (keyword in context) index concept,
providing a history of the concept and of its literature.. It discusses 
variations of the index, such as the Bell Telephone Index, KWOC indexes, and 
the WADEX..
   The paper discusses improvements and variations to the KWIC index, such as 
manipulation of the index line, variations of the code, addition of 
classification information, combination of author index and title index, and 
improvements to the preparation of the KWIC indexes, such as improvement of 
titles and use of a thesaurus, and discusses improvement of the use of the KWIC 
index.. The paper discusses the usage of the KWIC index and comments on the 
future of KWIC indexes of the KWIC concept..

   A function was developed for the optimum distribution of indexing terms by 
the number of postings.. This makes it possible to transmit information with 
maximum efficiency.. The comparison of the actual distribution of the term 
groups with the calculated optimum distribution provides an objective measure 
for evaluating any indexing system with respect to its efficiency as 
information transmission channel..

Relevance Disagreements and Unclear Request Forms
.A
O'Connor, John
.W
   Disagreements about the relevance of documents to retrieval requests occur
because relevance judges differently interpret requests of documents.. Requests
may be differently interpreted because they are unclear.. Well-known types of
request obscurity are reviewed.. Less well known is that a request may be 
unclear because its form - "documents about subject S", "document answering 
question Q", etc. - is unclear.. 
   Explications are developed of the meanings of the request forms just given 
and several others.. A request of any of the forms discussed is interpreted to 
be for documents which support statements of a specified kind in a specified 
way.. Examples are given which suggest that some, perhaps all, "about S" 
requests are unclear.. Some ways of formulating clear question requests are 
given..
   Various ways in which documents may support statements are distinguished..
These depend on on such factors as parts of a document use, inference strength,
and background knowledge permitted.. Some possible clear support specifications
are indicated..

   Although a large number of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) 
Systems have been planned, implemented, and tested over the past few years, 
insufficient attention has been given to the collection and interpretation of 
important data needed for evaluation.. We describe some of the defects common 
to almost all of the reported systems, single out one recent report for 
detailed discussion and argue in favor of collection and correct interpretation 
of data on one important and frequently overlooked evaluation factor..

as precision and recall, that have been suggested by other workers.. The new 
measure is based on calculations of the expected number of irrelevant documents
in the collection which would have to be searched through before the desired 
number of relevant documents could be found.. Its advantages are: (1) it 
provides  a single index of the property it attempts to measure; (2) it allows
for gradations of retrieval status, through the mathematical concept of a "weak 
ordering"; (3) it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching;
and (4) it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the 
requester..

A Literature Search and File Organization Model
.A
Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F.
.W
   A principle of sequential optimization in search theory distributes the 
search effort at each stage so as to maximize the probability of target 
detection with the effort expended thus far.. As an application of this 
principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file items
should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will 
yield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not be
feasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search 
zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative
efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone 
sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off
between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully 
evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature 
appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to 
demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters 
obtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search plan
to scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents 
are examined first.. Only about one of three searches should have to go on to a 
search over the remainder of the file..

The Publication Inflation
.A
London, Gertrude
.W
   The much-vaunted information explosion seems to be the manifestation of a 
rather generalized publication inflation.. Multipublication and pretentious
writing have become obstacles to "communication between human minds". To 
counteract their harmful effects it will be necessary to reduce the quantity 
and improve the quality of the printed records by filtering the material before 
it is stored for retrieval..

A Computer-Based Serials Control System for a Large Biomedical Library
.A
Roper, Fred W.
.W
   Rather than reiterate the obvious purposes and procedures involved in 
creating a computer system for control of serials, in this paper the author
deals with the concept upon which the UCLA system is based and the manner in
which the system is maintained in day-to-day operations of the UCLA Biomedical
Library.. The paper deals with some of the points made in an earlier publication
from the UCLA serials project.. The attempt is to show how the theory of 
publication pattern (discussed in the earlier article) has been used to 
produce a different idea in computer control of serials.. Publication pattern 
information which is entered into the master record for each title causes
check-in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the
computer, regardless of when this text issue is expected - next week, next
month, next year.. This is departure from most systems, which attempt to 
predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time 
period.. The information, which must be a part of the computer record, is 
described, as are library procedures in maintaining the system..

A Study of Searching the Eye Research Literature
.A
Miller, Russell R.
.W
   The paper is a report of most of the major findings of a study in searching
the periodical eye research literature.. Questions were collected from eye 
researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different 
secondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to 
the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye
research interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number
of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye
researchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign 
languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more 
than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the 
mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the 
researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective
searches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and 
Excerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources..
MEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual 
searches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be
equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were
subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers.. A searcher with a background
in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than 
other non-ophthalmologist searchers..

Psychology and Information
.A
Miller, George A.
.W
   An aspect of the human use of information that has generally been overlooked 
in the automation in information services is the human tendency to locate 
information spatially.. Computer-based systems do not necessarily assign any 
unique role to spatial tags, and so a feature of considerable importance for 
the organization of the user's memory seems to have been largely overlooked..
The spatial dimension of human memory is discussed, and some suggestions are 
offered for exploiting it more effectively in the context of information 
retrieval services..

The Use of Simulation in Studying Information Storage and Retrieval Systems
.A
Baker, Norman R.
.A
Nance, Richard E.
.W
   Previous applications of simulation to information storage and retrieval 
systems (ISRS) have been overly restrictive in their scope and have failed to
consider the environment within which such systems operate.. This paper 
considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the 
users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a 
closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both 
the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs 
within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis for
describing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to 
simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is 
the ISRS component.. The results which such an analysis can produce are 
discussed..

Retrieval of Answer-Providing Documents
.A
O'Connor, John
.W
   (I) Better understanding of subject document retrieval might result if 
different functions of subject document retrieval system are studied 
separately.. This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response 
to a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred 
("answer-providing documents").. "Answer can be inferred from document" has 
many possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an "inference 
specification").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the 
correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., 
any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference 
practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference 
practices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs 
in a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some 
apparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact is
described which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a 
question.. However, because the indexing is "nonrelational", it could cause 
false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals 
are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for 
helping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for 
retrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately..

On Understanding User Choices: Textual Correlates of Relevance Judgements
.A
Gifford, Carolyn
.A
Baumanis, George J.
.W
   An empirical investigation of the role of documents in relevance judgements
is reported.. Abstracts previously judged relevant, partially relevant, and 
nonrelevant to each of 61 questions were compared to see whether textual 
differences could be found which might reasonably account for the rating 
differences.. The results of this comparison were fairly clear-cut 
characterizations in each case of relevant and partially relevant abstracts.. 
These characterizations were found to be expressible largely as meaningful
co-occurrences of terms closely related to the question.. It is suggested that 
the textual bases of user choices may be more understandable than has been 
supposed..

Word-Word Associations in Document Retrieval Systems
.A
Lesk, M. E.
.W
   The SMART automatic document retrieval system is used to study association 
procedures for automatic content analysis.. The effect of word frequency and 
other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination
of related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of words
usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be
found from first or second order relationships in our document collections.. 
There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations 
and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations 
and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in 
retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches 
between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing 
matches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of 
the improvement possible with associations.. A properly constructed thesaurus,
however, offers better performance than statistical association methods..

Effectiveness of Information Retrieval Methods
.A
Swets, John
.W
   Results of some 50 different retrieval methods applied in three experimental 
retrieval systems were subjected to the analysis suggested by statistical 
decision theory.. The analysis validates a previously-proposed measure of
effectiveness and demonstrates its several desirable properties.. The 
examination of a wide range of data in relation to this one metric provides a 
clear and general assessment of the current state of the retrieval art..

Managerial Cost Accounting for a Technical Information Center
.A
Helmkamp, John G.
.W
   The purpose of this paper is to describe a research project conducted at a 
technical center to test the hypothesis that: A theoretically-sound managerial 
cost-accounting system can be designed to meet the specific characteristics of 
a technical information center by revising and innovating systems utilized by 
other enterprises.. A computerized cost system was developed and operated for
a three-month period to test this hypothesis.. The results of the study 
indicate that effective managerial cost accounting is possible for a technical
information center.. Relevant cost information was generated periodically to 
measure the operating performance of the center's production process.. A 
summary of the data that were reported regularly to management is presented 
in this paper..

Leith, John D. Jr.

   The author's journal reference cards for 1965 and 1966 were analyzed 
according to three "interest patterns": (I) the total collection of 1469 
article titles, a "potentially useful" set; (II) a subset concerning only his
research speciality; and (III) a subset of articles defined as "useful". For
each pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram 
was drawn..
   Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations
in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern 
III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse 
journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity 
of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect 
means..
   Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in 
building his card file, generated 88% of all articles.. Scatter diagrams 
indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use..
   The 30% most important journals in this collection, including about 80% of
titles, are ranked for each pattern..

The Effectiveness of Automatically Generated Weights and 
 Links in Mechanical Indexing
.A
Artandi, Susan
.A
Wolf, Edward H.
.W
   Work concerned with the statistical evaluation of the output of the MEDICO 
automatic indexing method is described.. The statistical test were designed
primarily to examine the validity of the assumptions which formed the basis of 
the algorithms developed for the automatic computation of weights and for the 
automatic generation of links between index terms and modifiers.. This 
evaluation also includes a comparison of the output generated from full text 
and from the processing of the abstracts or summaries of the same articles..

On-Line Access to Information: NSF as an Aid to the Indexer/Cataloger
.A
Bennet, John L.
.W
   When adding a document to a collection, an indexer should choose a 
representation which makes evident both the content of the document and its 
relation to other documents already in the collection.. Toward this end, the 
Negotiated Search Facility (NSF) makes possible indexer-controlled retrieval of 
information from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in a
traditional bibliographic catalog.. The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a 
framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data 
which he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which 
indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display
formats and command language promote interaction.. While the discussion is 
directed toward indexing, it should be clear that the facility would be equally
useful to the searcher..

Computer Selection of Keywords Using Word-Frequency Analysis
.A
Carroll, John M.
.A
Roeloffs, Robert
.W
   A statistically based method for automatically identifying keywords in 
machine-readable text has been developed which produces keyword lists that 
agree better with composite lists produced by panels of human indexers than do 
lists produced by five statistical criteria previously suggested, and also 
better than lists produced by most of the individual panel members.. The method
makes use of both the in-document word-occurrence frequency and the in-corpus
relative occurrence frequency as measures of word importance.. Each statistical
criterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rank
correlation statistics.. The simple word count was found to be superior to the
other four previously suggested criteria - all of which made use of the 
in-corpus relative occurrence frequency.. The test were conducted over 19
documents dealing with the subject of Information Science, a total of over 
66,000 word occurrences.. Seventeen indexers representing eight different 
information centers participated in experiments..

A Graphic Catalog Card Index
.A
Lewis, Elizabeth M.
.W
   To improve accessibility and maintenance of art slides in the United States
Military Academy Library at West Point, a model card with a graphic image of 
the slide was designed with pertinent identifying information displayed 
directly above a black-and-white opaque photo and also key-punched into it.. 
The card serves for ample comparison reference previous to handling the slides
and can produce a subject-arranged permuted index in book form.. The later 
permits access from the approach of form, geographic area, name, time of 
origin, artist, school, or style, etc.. Some added advantages, common to other 
kinds of graphic collections, are detailed.. Estimated costs of 
photo-reproduction of original cards, various kinds of copies, and computer 
time and materials are listed.. Future benefits from a consistent, unified 
cataloging system for graphic objects and the dissemination of this kind of 
information in a network structure are indicated as major goals..

Indexing Consistency and Quality
.A
Zunde, Pranas
.A
Dexter, Margaret E.
.W
   A measure of indexing consistency is developed based on the concept of 
"fuzzy-sets".. It assigns a higher consistency value if indexers agree on the 
more important terms.. Measures of the quality of an indexer's work and 
exhaustivity of indexing are also proposed.. Experimental data on indexing 
consistency is presented for certain categories of indexers; and consistency,
quality, and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed.. The analysis of 
indexing exhaustivity leads to the conclusion that the increase of information
as a result of group indexing is a process analogous to Bradford's law of
information scattering, Lotka's law of scientific productivity, and Zipf's law
of vocabulary distribution..

Is Interindexer Consistency A Hobgoblin?
.A
Cooper, William S.
.W
   It is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced 
under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the 
indexing.. To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the 
possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. A
specific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be
invalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain
insights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and 
successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected.. It is
concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived, 
measurements of inter-indexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to
indexing quality..

The Cost Analysis of Document Surrogation:  A Literature Review
.A
Landau, Herbert B.
.W
   A state-of-the art literature review on the cost of classification, 
cataloging, indexing, and abstracting has been included.. It was found that
while some data on specific costs are available, the literature is generally
found lacking from the point of view of accuracy, completeness, consistency,
and availability..

Some Independent Agreements and Resolved Disagreements 
   About Answer-Providing Documents
.A
O'Connor, John
.W
   Eighty-two documents and 30 questions, in documentation and related areas, 
was compared to find answer-providing documents (documents from which answers to 
questions can be inferred).. Two judges (documentation experts) made 
comparisons independently.. They discussed their disagreements, attempting to
resolve them.. In each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what
answer he inferred, and from what document passage(s).. The further discussion
depended on the details of each case.. In general, the resolution procedures 
used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer-providing
or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement (about a passage's
meaning, a statement's correctness, or an inference's correctness).. This seems
better than treating relevance judgements as subjective and not open to 
rational discussion..

Information Science: Toward the Development of a True Scientific Discipline
.A
Yovits, M. C.
.W
   It is pointed out that if information science is to be considered a "true" 
science similar to physics or chemistry then it must have a set of concepts and
analytical expression which apply to the flow of information in a general way..
In several previous papers, the author and a colleague have described a model 
of a generalized information system which has  wide, and perhaps universal 
applicability.. This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of 
its applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in 
a way which allows for quantification.. It is pointed out in this paper that 
this model can be the basis for the development of a "true" science of 
information with all of the necessary requirements for a science.. By the use 
of this model and the definition of a "true" science, the goals and requirements 
for a curriculum in information science are thus established.. Within this 
context, information is defined as data of value in decision making.. 
Quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to 
specific observable actions which can be measured physically..

A Comparison of a Keyword from Title Index with a Single Access Point 
 per Document Alphabetic Subject Index
.A
Jahoda, G.

Stursa, Mary Lou
.W
   Two indexes to a collection of 3,204 documents in the field of chemistry 
were  test-searched.. The indexes are a keyword from title index without added
keywords and a single access point per document alphabetic subject index.. The
indexes were searched by 13 graduate chemistry students using 55 questions..
Search results are characterized in terms of recall, precision, and search 
time.. There is no statistically significant difference in recall and precision
search result between the multiple access points per document keyword from 
title index and the single access point per document alphabetic subject index..
Search time was significantly better for the alphabetic subject index for all 
but those questions having only one relevant document..

Patterns of Name Ordering among Authors of Scientific Papers:
A study of Social Symbolism and Its Ambiguity
.A
Zuckerman, Harriet A.
.W
   With increasing scientific collaboration, visibility of individual 
role-performance has diminished.. Ordering of author' names as an adaptive 
device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews 
with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of 
other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of 
individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected 
distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular 
sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the 
assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their 
contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other 
scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse 
oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their 
eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent 
laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet 
unrecognized.. The noblesse oblige, however, has its limits; laureates' 
contributions to prize-winning research are more visible than contributions to 
their other research..

Professional Standing and the Reception of Scientific Discoveries
.A
Cole, S.
.W
  The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition
for a particular scientific contribution depending on their
location in the stratification system.  Merton originally introduced
the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of
multiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is
generalized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect
were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be
influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system.
To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of
similar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations
papers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of
papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2.
We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of
these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's
location in the stratification system.  All the data indicate
that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important 
determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification
variables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality
is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work
that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The
Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious
points of the social system of science.  All other stratification
variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards
did not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that
indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no 
more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-
ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus
attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with
scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility
of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussion
is included of the relevance of these data for the study of
resistance to scientific discoveries.

Involving, Computerizing, Personalizing
.A
Kilgour, F.
.W
  In most libraries most users face a complex, monolithic arrangement
of entries in catalogs and books on shelves.  In classical librarianship no
effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of
volumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except for
that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users 
remain nameless.
  The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as
individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential
for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of
which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as
one-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the only
contribution computerization will make to libraries.
  Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new
objectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon
that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small special
libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural
activities of the individuals in their communities rather than
merely make available a torpid "service." Libraries must look forward to
supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an
objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.

OCLC for You - and ME?!
.A
Plotnick, A.
.W
  Sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps; those
who seem to know all about this thing called "OCLC" and who keep popping that
rounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence,
and the other camp - plain folk who are happy to take library life one
acronym at a time, as they need it, and who, if pressed, might guess that OCLC
has something to do with, oh, Optical Codes at the Library of Congress?
  Only in Ohio - where the Ohio College Library Center began and where
this national, computerized, bibliographic data exchange continues to grow -
is OCLC universally a library household term, even among computer-phobes.  In
Ohio, most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at OCLC is
not simply the building up of someone else's data base in little bits and bytes,
but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since books
were unchained from the shelves.

The American Occupational Structure
.A
Blau, P.M.
.W
  This book is the result of a collaborative effort extending over seven
years.  We have tried hard to make the book a genuine joint product
to which each of us made the contributions he is best qualified to
make.  There is no senior author; the sequence of name is simply
alphabetical, and we have reversed it in signing the preface and elsewhere
to emphasize this fact.  Our collaboration was motivated by our shared
interest in social stratification, our common concern with advancing
scientific social theory on the basis of systematic research, and the
conviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualifications
and viewpoints the two of us represent.  There can be no doubt
that our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ to
a considerable degree.  Although we agree that refining research methods
and advancing social theory are both important, for example, it is
only fair to state that Duncan lays more stress on deriving theoretical
generalizations.

American Overseas Library Technical Assistance, 1940-1970
.A
Brewster, B.J.
.W
     The United States has been engaged in activities known
variously as technical assistance, technical cooperation, or
development assistance for the past twenty-five years.  This
form of foreign aid, either government sponsored or privately
supported, is a twentieth century phenomenon.  The broader
concept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing 
another country with any kind of goods, whether financial,
commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, and
extends to antiquity.  Technical assistance, which may be
defined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques,
is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels
America's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition
as an important industrial and trade power.  Government use
of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well as
the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign
assistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt's
Good Neighbor Policy.  This integration soon expanded under
the new cultural relations program which the United
States implemented during World War II to offset the Nazi
propaganda and cultural offensive in Latin America.

Scientific Communication:  Five Themes from Social Science Research
.A 
Menzel, H.
.W
  The recent upsurge of interest in the behavioral aspects of scientific and 
technical communication and information flow has two distinct sources, a 
theoretical one in the development of communication research, and a practical 
one in the concerns of policy makers in scientific organizations and 
information services.
  For some time past, the attention of sociologists and social psychologists 
studying communication processes, once focused on so-called mass phenomena
and mass publics, has turned to the interplay of communication processes with 
more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure.  
One aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by 
behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized 
sort, and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information. 
The scientific and applied professions have been most prominent among the 
publics so studied.

Communication Patterns in Applied Technology
.A
Marquis, D.G.
Allen, T.J.
.W
  The preceding papers have addressed themselves
to the study of information flow in a particular
stream of human activity which has been variously called
science, pure science, basic research, or
fundamental research, and which
is only secondarily, if at all, concerned
with the practical utilization of its products.
At this point it is appropriate to note that there is
a parallel activity which includes applied research,
exploratory development, and engineering development.
This second stream of research we will call technology.
Far more is known about the flow of information
among scientists than among technologists.  From
the knowledge that is available, however, we are
led to conclude that the communication patterns  
in the two areas of activity are not only largely
independent of one another, but qualitatively
different in their nature.  This difference is
reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by
which information is diffused within the two
sets of practitioners.  The present paper is
addressed to these differences and to a discussion
of the nature of the communication process between
science and technology.

Bibliographical Citation Characteristics of the Psychological
Journal Network in 1950 and in 1960
.A
Xhignesse, L.V.
Osgood, C.E.
.W
  The aforementioned studies are related to the
problem of information exchange in psychology.
Journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific
communication as well as storage elements for
the summary accounts of research undertakings.
Analysis of bibliographical citations thus can
reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of
information flow created by scientists in their
work.  The potential usefulness of this type of
investigation is increased when it becomes
possible to examine the trends through time of the
communication network under consideration, and also 
when different communication networks can be compared.
  The present paper deals with some of the
characteristics of bibliographical citations in the
same 21 psychological journals published both in
1950 and in 1960. The list of journals used, along
with the abbreviations to be used here, is given in
Table 1; it includes 8 journals published by the
American Psychological Association and 13 journals
published by other organizations.

Scientific Communication:
Its Role in the Conduct of Research and Creation of Knowledge
.A
Garvey, W.D
Griffith, B.C.
.W
  There is considerable apprehension today
within the scientific community over the
communication crisis in science.  The present
article, which attempts to clarify certain aspects
of the problem, overviews the data collected by the
APA Project on Scientific Information Exchange in
Psychology, together with data which we have
more recently obtained relative to other disciplines.
Such a reexamination of the data should help to
clarify APA's relationship to the many information
media involved in the communication process
which begins with research and ends with the
incorporation of research findings into psychological
knowledge.

Ecological Correlations and the Behavior of Individuals
.A
Robinson, W.S.
.W
  An individual correlation is a correlation
in which the statistical object or thing
described is indivisible.  The correlation
between color and illiteracy for
persons in the United States, shown later in
Table 1, is an individual correlation, because
the kind of thing described is an indivisible
unit, a person.  In an individual correlation
the variables are descriptive properties of
individuals, such as height, income, eye
color, or race, and not descriptive statistical
constants such as rates or means.
  In an ecological correlation the statistical
object is a group of persons.  The correlation
between the percentage of the population
which is Negro and the percentage of the
population which is illiterate for the 48
states, shown later as Figure 2, is an 
ecological correlation.  The thing described
is the population of a state, and not a single
individual.  The variables are percentages,
descriptive properties of groups, and not
descriptive properties of individuals.

Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science
.A
Merton, R.K.
.W
  We can only guess what historians of the 
future will say about the condition of
present-day sociology.  But it seems
safe to anticipate one of their observations.
When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that 
history - as they well might, for this clan
of historians promises to go on forever -
they will doubtless find it strange that so
few sociologists (and historians) of the
twentieth century could bring themselves,
in their work, to treat science as one of the
great social institutions of the time.  They
will observe that long after the sociology of
science became an identifiable field of
inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a
world where science loomed large enough to
present mankind with the choice of destruction
or survival.  They may even suggest
that somewhere in the process by which social
scientists take note of the world as it is
and as it once was, a sense of values appears
to have become badly scrambled.

Social Factors in the Origins of a New Science: The Case of Psychology
.A
Ben-David, Joseph
.A
Collins, Randall
.W
   The uninterrupted growth of a scientific field depends upon the existence of 
a scientific community permanently devoting itself to the field.. Therefore, the
new idea is not sufficient to start the take-off into sustained growth in a new 
field; a new role must be created as well.. In scientific psychology, this 
occurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a 
positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it
is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring
the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and
from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its 
consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of 
the human mind into an experimental science..

Scientific Output and Recognition:
     A Study in the Operation of the Reward System in Science
.A
Cole, Stephen
.A
Cole, Jonathan R.
.W
   The relationship between the quantity and quality of scientific output of 
120 university physicists was studied.. Although these two variables are highly
correlated, some physicists produce many papers of little significance and 
other produce a few papers of great significance.. The responses of the 
community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication were
investigated.. Quality of output is more significant than quantity in eliciting
recognition through the receipt of awards, appointment to prestigious academic
departments, and being widely known to one's colleagues.. The reward system 
operates to encourage creative scientists to be highly productive, to divert 
the energies of less creative physicists into other channels, and to produce a 
higher correlation between quantity and quality of output in the top departments 
than in the weaker departments..

Nobel Laureates in Science:
 Patterns of Productivity, Collaboration, and Authorship
.A
Zuckerman, Harriet
.W
   Nobel laureates in science publish more and are more apt to collaborate than 
a matched sample of scientists.. Interviews with 41 of 55 laureates and 
comparison of their research output with the output of the matched sample 
indicate that these patterns hold at every stage of the life-work-cycle.. As
laureates report and as their publications collaborate, they exercise noblesse
oblige in arranging co-authorship in collaborative publications.. Receipt of 
the Nobel prize is followed by declining productivity and changed work 
practices, as a result of changed role obligations and activities.. Reductions 
in productivity are more severe for laureates who experience comparatively 
large increments in prestige through the prize than for those who were already 
eminent.. The prize generates strain in collaborative associations so that most 
of these terminate soon after the award..

Visibility and the Structural Bases of Awareness of Scientific Research
.A
Cole, Stephen
.A
Cole, Jonathan R.
.W
   The paper contains an analysis of several aspects of the communication 
process in science.. Using data obtained from printed sources and questionnaires
mailed to university physicists, the conditions making for high visibility of a
scientists' work are studied.. Four strong determinates of visibility were
found: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards 
received for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to which
the scientist belong; and speciality.. Quantity of output, age, and 
name-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on 
visibility.. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high 
visibility), other are in positions where they may easily see.. This latter
characteristic is called "awareness"..The data indicate that awareness is high 
in all sectors of the population studied.. Variables such as age, rank of 
department, and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness.. 
We conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently..

Social Structure in a Group of Scientists:
 A Test of the "Invisible College" Hypothesis
.A
Crane, Diana
.W
   The existence of social organization within a research area may be inferred 
(a) if scientists who have published in the area have more social ties with one 
another than with scientists who have not published, and (b) scientists who 
have published in the area can be differentiated by degree od social 
participation within the area.. Using the mail questionnaire, sociometric data
on different types of scientific relationships were obtained from scientists, 
all of whom had published in a particular problem area.. Respondents chose
scientists who had not published in the area as often as they chose scientists
within the area.. Analysis of direct and indirect ties, using Cleman's method
for analysis of sociometric connectedness, revealed that a tie with one or more
of the highly productive scientists brought other scientists of less
productivity into a large network of influence and communication.. Similarities
between this type of social organization and that of the "social circle" are
discussed..

Growth and Decay Curves in Scientific Citations
.A
MacRae, Duncan Jr.
.W
   In a rapidly advancing scientific discipline, new contributions will 
supersede older ones.. This selection in favor of recent literature should be
observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline, by
age of article cited.. However, the age distribution of citations also depends
on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature.. The effect of growth of 
the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, if
certain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and 
clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fit
to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application 
suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those
in the natural sciences..A parameter in the model, measuring the degree of
selectivity in favor of recent articles, can be estimated and may be useful in
comparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines..

The Structure of Scientific Fields and 
  the Functioning of University Graduate Departments
.A
Lodahl, Janice Beyer
.A
Gordon, Gerald
.W
   Kuhn's concept of paradigm suggests that academic disciplines could be viewed
as technologies involving degree of task predictability.. A series of hypotheses
were developed in which relatively high paradigm development in a discipline was 
predicted to facilitate research and teaching through improved processes of 
communication and access to stored information.. Using questionnaire data 
collected from 80 university graduate departments, physicists and chemists were 
found to exhibit more agreement over field content, and to be more willing and 
satisfied to spend time with graduate students than sociologists and political 
scientists.. In addition, chemists were found to collaborate with larger 
numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields..
Two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed: the level of innovation 
being pursued within a field of a given time, and the degree of 
institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines..

Productivity Differences among Scientists:
  Evidence for Accumulative Advantage
.A
Allison, Paul D.
.A
Stewart, John A
.W
   The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be 
partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedback
through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or
increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce
even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the
distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of
scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for
chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in
inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with 
a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of 
accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity,
resources and esteem increases as career age increases..

The Distribution of Social and Cultural Properties in Informal Communication
 Networks Among Biological Scientists
.A
Mullins, Nicholas C.
.W
   Informal communication among biological scientists forms a discernible 
social structure.. This research analyzes the relation of that structure to (1)
scientists' descriptions of their research and the orientations that underlie 
those descriptions, (2) social status in science, and (3) the formal social 
categories of science (i.e. discipline, department, and research organization)..
Each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model.. Neither 
social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the
social structure than to the random model.. The culture of science, on the other
hand, as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying 
those descriptions, shows very strong associations with the discerned network 
structures..

The Gatekeepers of Science:  Some Factors Affecting
the Selection of Articles of Scientific Journals
.A
Crane, D.
.W
  The norms of scientific behavior as
described by Merton include the
prescription that scientific achievements
are to be judged without reference to
scientists' social characteristics.  This
article will attempt to assess the extent
to which this norm is followed with
respect to the evaluation of articles by
scientific journals.

Bibliographical Reference Patterns in Core
Sociological Journals, 1965-1966
.A
Lin, N.
Nelson, C.E.
.W
  The present study attempted to extend previous work on
bibliographical reference patterns in sociological journals
in the following ways: (1) by selecting for study those
journals to which American sociologists prefer to submit
their work, (2) by including, over a two-year period, all
bibliographical references (journals, books, technical
reports, etc.), and (3) by including, for initial comparison,
a journal from the physical sciences.  Such a study, it was
hoped, would yield data concerning similarities and
differences among the sociological journals and between
the sociological journals and the physical science journal.

Sociology Today:  Lacunae, Emphases, and Surfeits
.A
Brown, J.S.
Gilmartin, B.G.
.W
  In sociology today, as in other sciences, the professional
journals serve as major channels for the dissemination of
ideas and information.  The papers presented in the
principal periodicals reach a wide audience among sociologists,
are acknowledged as the best work, and stand as
models for all who aspire to success.  The viewpoints, conceptual 
schemes, interests, and methodologies reflected in
these articles are therefore significant influences on both
the current character and the future development of our
discipline.

Measuring the Quality of Sociological Research:
Problems in the Use of the Science Citation Index
.A
Cole, S.
.W
The Problem of assessing the "quality" of scientific
publications has long been a major impediment to
progress in the sociology of science.  Most researchers
have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of
output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone
ahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963;
Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemed
to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large
numbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers of
scientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index
(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool
to measure the significance of individual scientists'
contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all
bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large
number of journals.  The number of citations an
individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator
of the relative scientific significance or "quality" of that
individual's publications.

  This book is intended to supply the background needed for
participation in the analysis and design of information-handling
systems and for understanding the literature in the field.
I have tried to present a unified approach to the subject
and to the relation of information retrieval to other
disciplines and an appreciation of the importance of this
interdisciplinary relationship.  I hope that the scientist
or computer programmer, newly interested in information-retrieval
problems, as well as the librarian, will find the book of value.

Analysis of Library User Circulation Requirements
.A
Trueswell, Richard W.
.W
   This research study is concerned with the use of the last circulation date 
as a statistic to help describe library user circulation requirements.. Some 
decision rules were developed to use this parameter as an aid in determining the
number of copies of books to be held in the library and as an aid in the
weeding of books from the library's holdings.. The effect of these decision
rules on the circulation requirements of users as well as on library operations 
are described.. The method of data collection is described in detail and is 
applicable at libraries having comparable charging systems.. Cumulative 
distribution functions of last circulation date at two large college libraries 
and a public library were prepared and have been plotted for both circulation 
data and stack holding data.. This same data has also been plotted by subdivided
subject category.. Circulation operating characteristics were prepared for all
three libraries..

   Due to the fact that scientific-technical research is constantly increasing,
it is becoming more and more difficult to retrieve the published results of 
research.. A new field of science, documentation, has been developed as a 
contribution to the removal of this difficulty.. Depending on the type and 
extent of the subject different methods for its documentation will be followed..
Methods and possibilities for the comprehensive documentation of chemistry and 
its related fields are explained..

TOSAR - A Topological method for the Representation of Synthetic and 
Analytical Relations of Concepts
.A
Fugmann, Robert
Nickelsen, Herbert
Nickelsen, Ingeborg
Winter, Jacob H.
.W
   In mechanized systems used for searching in literature stores there is a 
steadily growing necessity not only to be able to formulate concepts as a
search condition but also the characteristic connections under which these
concepts appear in the inquiry.. In this way the precision of the mechanized
literature search is considerably increased.. TOSAR has been developed in 
order to improve computerized literature searching in this respect..

  In the literature, active network plans and developments appear to cluster 
in three main areas: (1) Education, (2) Libraries, and (3) Government, Industry,
and Professional Societies.  These network groupings are described in this
chapter following a discussion of network definitions, concepts, and current
impetus.  References to information systems are included when there is an 
indication that a particular system will probably be transformed into a network.

Design and Evaluation of Information Systems
.A
Katter, R.V.
.W
  In corresponding chapters of earlier volumes of this review 
may be discerned a trend toward progressive broadening of
content coverage.  The initial emphasis was on design and
evaluation concepts and on techniques that were rather closely -  
and narrowly - connected with information storage and retrieval
systems.  It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that
there are many activities and ideas outside of this context
that have, or can have, a very important bearing on the work
of systems analysts, designers, and evaluators working on
library and documentation systems.  This chapter attempts
to continue enlarging our perception of the range of reported
activities that can help to improve the kinds of systems in which
our readers are chiefly interested.

Document Dissemination
.A
Landau, H.B.
.W
  This chapter is directed to those whose vocation (or avocation)
is information.  While we may call ourselves librarians, information
scientists or technologists, abstractors and indexers, documentalists,
IS&R specialists, literature searchers, and so forth, we all have one
thing in common: We are either directly or indirectly involved in the
dissemination of information.  As disseminators, we are interested
in far more than the techniques for transmission of information from
one point to another.  Despite McLuhan's (93) statement that "the
medium is the message," we must concern ourselves with not only the
means of document dissemination, but also the content and value of
the documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughout
most of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator should
think of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data,
evaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controlling
their transmission to a target: the reader.

Information Networks
.A
Overhage, C.F.J.
.W
  The rapidly growing rate at which information is produced and
used in our complex society has presented us with major problems
in information transfer.  We encounter these problems not only
in libraries, information centers, and schools, but also in many
of the operations of government and business.  The handling of large
amounts of information is becoming a dominant theme in the management
of our way of life.  We are a technologically oriented society, and
we have naturally turned to our communications technology to help
us perform our enormous information transfer task.  Beginning with
the telegraph and continuing through the telephone, through radio 
and television to the communications satellite, the methods of
electrical signal transmission have served to distribute information
to its ultimate users.

Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1972
.W
  In spite of concerns expressed in the literature about
the health and vigor of the field of information science and
of its service-oriented institutions - libraries and information
centers - the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds for
optimism.  Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6
have proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movement
toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases 
is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before
satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will
help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the
standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally)
held data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects 
of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive
systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and
Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination
systems.
  This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially
great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes.
It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in
the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of
some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define 
the potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other new
areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal
justice system and information system applications in the humanities.
  In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas
of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an
annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description
and representation, and organization of information.  This
coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master
plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest
in library and information science.

The User Interface in Interactive Systems
.A
Bennett, J.L.
.W
  The digital computer has been used as a problem-solving tool for only
two decades.  During most of this time, computer scientists have
concentrated on learning how to build the tool: applying electronic
technology, arranging for data flow between components, and manufacturing
the hardware.  Now we are entering a new stage in which computing
power is made available through interactive terminals to people who
are not computer scientists.  This is possible on a large scale only
because design and marketing innovators now have confidence in their
ability to provide reliable, cost-effective service to less sophisticated
users.  In this new stage, the natural behavior patterns of users become
an important element in the design of the interface to the tool.

Machine-Readable Bibliographic Data Bases
.A
Gechman, Marvin C.
.W
   The advent of machine-readable data bases is one of the most significant 
forward steps in information retrieval.. Currently, the creation and 
application of these data bases are in a period of very rapid growth.. This
reviewer sees a great need for a review of "what is going on" because there is 
so much going on.. It is the goal of this chapter to fulfill that need even 
though it is difficult to hold this dynamic field static for a good meaningful 
look..

Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1974
.W
  The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and
services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review
chapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking,
began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment
of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts
to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information "utilities."
These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being
cost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only
promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new
problems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions
requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance
to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user
subgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning
and design, including intelligent consideration of the "make versus buy"
issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and
considerations.
  One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth
in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated
by the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The
apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same
problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among
library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed
materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less
rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs,
serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The
inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series -
reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the
ownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of that
controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services
in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's
chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.

Use of Machine-Readable Data Bases
.A
Williams, M.E.
.W
  This is the first Annual Review chapter entitled "Use of Machine-
Readable Data Bases."  Therefore, the coverage provided is for more than
a one-year period.  A chapter by Gechman (79) on machine-readable
bibliographic data bases included literature from 1969 through 1971.  A
chapter by Housman (100) covered the use of data bases for selective
dissemination of information (SDI) and a chapter by Parkins & Kennedy
(153) has previously reviewed secondary information services.  This
chapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlier
data base papers not treated in prior chapters.
  For purposes of this chapter, a data base is considered to be an
organized set of machine-readable records containing bibliographic
or document-related data.

Design and Evaluation of Information Systems
.A
Swanson, R.W.
.W
  The co-joining of "design" with "evaluation" that is called for by this
chapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for the
author.  In part, "design" and "evaluation" prescribe two separate sets
of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and
testing of new information system structures and modification of existing
structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational
systems and system components.  However, "design" includes not only the
formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for
evaluation in accordance with expectations.  "Evaluation" applies to
testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations
for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the
appraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of system
operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications
that require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of "design" and
"evaluation" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in
his 1969 review.
  "Design" and "evaluation" may be examined methodologically or with
respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly,
designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of
outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literature
discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on
their products.

Generation and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases
.A
Schipma, P.B.
.W
  This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of
machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  It
is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared
in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation.
  The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications
used in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is considered
to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing
bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information).
The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage
and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or
data base generation.
  The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First,
data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic
information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded.
Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number
is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as
that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39)
are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material
is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most
of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a
shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this
chapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation
of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production
operation.

Cooperation in Information Activities Through International Organizations
.A
Adams, S.
Werdel,J.A.
.W
  International cooperation in the processing, sharing, and transfer of
scientific and technical information takes many forms and can be
accomplished through many agencies.  This chapter proposes to review
the role played by international organizations in stimulating and
providing channels and mechanisms for such cooperation.  The international
organizations to be discussed are of two types: intergovernmental organizations
(IGOs), in which member nations participate through their governments under
formal treaties or agreements; and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
where, with some exceptions, participation is through national professional
societies or nongovernmental institutions.  The specialized agencies of the
United Nations, including UNESCO, fall in the first category; organizations
such as the International Federation for Documentation (FID) are in the
second.

Introduction to the ADI Annual Review
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1966
.W
  Over the past 15 or 20 years, a new and growing field of inquiry
has begun to take shape.  This field, which will be referred to as "Information
Science and Technology," draws on fragments and fringes of a number
of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The element
that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a
shared deep concern with "information" - its generation, transformation,
communication, storage, retrieval, and use.
  Because of the universality of information processes, and also because
of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very
little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology,
or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put it
simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood
field of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell,
even clear agreement on what the word "information" itself means and
particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a
commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged.
Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need
not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest
to users, designers, and students of information systems and services.
The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume,
is to provide such a review.

Information Needs and Uses in Science and Technology
.A
Menzel, H.
.W
The way in which scientists and engineers make use of the information
systems at their disposal, the demands that they put to them, the
satisfaction achieved by their efforts, and the resultant impact on their
further work are among the items of knowledge which are necessary for the wise
planning of science information systems and policy.  Besides, these
matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested
in human organization and communication.  While "user studies" have
not yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963
seems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical research
on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  For
this first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies that
made their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give the
reader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research
has witnessed progress along the following lines:
    Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application
  of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in
  this field earlier in less rigorous forms;
    The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution
  development records; comparison of research teams working on identical
  tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before; 
  and
    An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the
  information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American
  Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research
  in this area.

Evaluation of Information Systems and Services
.A
Rees, A.M.
.W
  This chapter summarizes and discusses the present state of the art in
testing and evaluation.  Three tasks will be undertaken: to outline in
some detail the few substantive research projects involving testing and
evaluation, to describe a number of research projects in areas cognate to
testing and evaluation, and finally, to provide some general conclusions
with respect to past and future activity.  Although a distinction is made
in this review between laboratory-based experimentation and tests of
operational systems, the methodology used in each instance is substantially
the same.  As yet, no full-scale and elaborate field approach has been
attempted.

Design of Information Systems and Services
.A
Borko, H.
.W
  This review has selected for emphasis reports on concepts of systems
analysis and on the procedures for applying these concepts to the design
of information systems.  Literature dealing with the automation of libraries
and information centers has been explicitly excluded, while material on
user studies, file organization, evaluation, etc., is only mentioned briefly
since it is covered more thoroughly in other chapters.
  The selected, relevant, and available literature that has been published
in the last year or so is organized into four groups as follows:
     1. Articles that help define the process of systems analysis and
     the relationship to information science.
     2. Articles that describe the concepts of systems analysis as
     applied to the analysis and design of information systems.
     3. Articles primarily concerned with the design of document
     storage and retrieval systems.

The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1968
.W
  The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology is now in its
third year.  Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe and
evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field
during the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards
and our means of professional communication.
  The field of information science and technology continues to evolve and
grow.  As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas of
interest change in importance.  Accordingly, our pattern of coverage
changes.  The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and Information
Centers, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering 
automation of technical processes and the other covering document
networks, and a new chapter has been added on information system
applications in education.  Such applications are important not just because
they involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities but
because they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of
value to anyone interested in the total communication process.
   At the same time, "core" chapters of the review are continued:  information
needs and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organization
and search; publication and distribution techniques; automated language
processing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation;
and professional aspects of information science.
These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and their
annual literature is significant, large, and growing.

Information Needs and Uses
.A
Paisley, W.J.
.W
  Information science meets behavioral science in the study of information
needs and uses.  At first, the meeting of these fields was inconclusive.  Until
the mid-1960's, there were only a few substantial studies of information
needs and uses.  Since about 1963, however, a significant literature has
grown rapidly.
  There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields.
When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data on
users' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating
information system performance.  When behavioral scientists glimpse the
full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval
processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to "the information problem."
  This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue.
Information science and behavioral science need each other.  Big Science
needs them both.

The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1969
.W
  This, the fourth volume of the Annual Review of Information Science and
Technology, is both like and unlike its predecessors.  The basic objective -
to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review
ever prepared in the information science field - remains the same, as do the
basic areas of interest and coverage.  Too, the primary emphasis continues
to be on published literature and reports, to permit the reader to identify,
locate, and examine interesting and important sources of information
about various aspects of our technical progress.
  Some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year.  For the
first time, a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on
the international aspects of information transfer have been included.  Also,
the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usually
covered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters this
year.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for better
signposts within each volume, is the division of the book into several
major segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents of
the section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in some
instances, one or two highlights of the year's technical progress.

Information Needs and Uses
.A
Allen, T.J.
.W
  Previous authors in this series, writing on this subject, have usually felt 
it necessary to begin with a statement concerning the state of the
methodology of "user" studies.  They have, for the most part, found it
improved over the past, and this year is no exception in that regard.
There remains, however, the tendency on the part of many who are untrained
in social science methodology to assume that the art of questionnaire design
and administration is a very simple one that anyone with intelligence can
master in a single attempt.  One never realizes how truly wrong this view is
until he finds himself the author of a review chapter and is then confronted
with the sort of trivia that many authors submit as research papers.

Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1970
.W
  The field of information science and technology continues to grow
and, as it grows, to show new emphases and explore new areas of interest.
Volume 5 reflects these changes.  The increasing interest in
and movement toward library networks and other cooperative,
technology-supported information activities have helped to focus
special attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology,
the two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems,
but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications.
Thus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the first
time, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry
that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use
information-handling systems.
  Two other first-time chapters cover management information systems
and information systems in state and local government.  While
the intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds of
services they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services of
library and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheral
areas some information parallels.  Indeed, one of the reasons for the
Annual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is to
help its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solving
techniques they are fostering.

Application of Computer Technology to Library Process: a syllabus
.A
Becker, J.
.W
  The application of computer technology to library and
network processes and services is not an end in itself, but
rather a means of narrowing the gap between the demand
for library services and the ability of libraries to provide
those services.  Libraries have assumed the active role of
serving the informational, educational and recreational needs
of the population.  The size of that population grows constantly,
its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of
leisure time is increasing.
  The application of computer technology to libraries,
especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in
the performance of library functions, is a complex process
and demands the highest level of talent of both the library
and computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot be
accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design
of a library system is a team effort between librarians,
computer system analysts, and programmers.  Even a
limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to
fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallest
project will affect nearly all operations of the library.  For
these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at
least a general overview of what library automation is all
about.

  A distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate and
record knowledge.  The tools of communication have ranged from clay to
satellites.  Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded
knowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this
purpose.
  The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is
constantly being elevated as more and more information is presented.
Without information and its necessary control, a society is not only
stagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlled
by archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it
is destined to experience in an ever-changing environment.
  Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archives
contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations
grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a
country's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives and
libraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information to
succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In this
way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass
this memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutions
contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human
heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions,
develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain.

The Area Specialist Bibliographer: an inquiry into his role 
.A
Stuart, R.D.
.W
  It is the intent of this volume to develop a model designed
to eliminate present difficulties and ambiguities and
to improve administrative procedures for future development
of area programs.  This will be accomplished by giving
some indication of the climate of opinion toward area specialist
bibliographers and by isolating factors which influence
these opinions.  These attitudes will be presented by the
perceptions of area bibliographers toward their role and the
expectations of faculty and library administrators toward that
role.  The bibliographer's academic, professional, and
educational experience will be examined in this framework.

The Art of Computer Programming
.A
Knuth, D.E.
.W
  The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially
attractive because it not only can be economically and scientifically
rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like composing
poetry or music.  This book is the first volume of a seven-volume set
of books that has been designed to train the reader in the various skills
which go into a programmer's craft.

ASIDIC Survey of Information Center Services
.A
Williams, M.E.
.W
     The data in that survey covered the year 1971.  Many recipients
of the 1972 document have requested updated information.  Accordingly,
the ASIDIC Cooperative Data Management Committee initiated a new survey.
The questionnaires were mailed out in January of 1975 and responses
came in throughout the year.  Questionnaires were sent to all member
organizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sent
to individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI.
     Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in
1976.  Because of the time delay in producing the final compilation
the reader is warned against using this survey as an up-to-date source
for information as to which centers are processing which data bases.
     Of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and
41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers.  Of the 75
that process data bases (i.e., spin tapes) 51 (68%) are members of ASIDIC
and/or EUSIDIC.  This survey provides representative data for data base
processing organizations.  The use of online search services was
relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be
representative of the 1976 online situation.

Research on Users' Needs: Where is it Getting Us?
.A
Hanson, C.W.
.W
  Since Bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature
for the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference, at least
three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of
scientists and engineers for information, of their information gathering
habits, and the use to which they put information.
  Some of these have been concerned with the people in individual
organizations, but have implications elsewhere.  Others, including
Aslib's own investigations, have had wider aims.  Some have been
based upon observations and records of what the scientists and
engineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demands
they made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions,
and collections of facts.

The Cranfield Tests on Index Language Devices

   The investigation dealt with the effect which different devices have on the
performance of index languages.. It appeared that the most important 
consideration was the specificity of the index terms; within the context of the
conditions existing in this test, single-word terms were more effective than 
concept terms or a controlled vocabulary..

Current Awareness Searches on CT, CBAS and ASCA
.A
Abbot, M.T.J.
Hunter, P.S.
Simkins, M.A.
.W
  During the past year we have been one of the organizations
participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use
of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical-
Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness.  For some
time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation
Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific
Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These
three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the
same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current
awareness service.
  CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only
authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by 
breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved.
CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with
biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for
computer search.  The computer can also search for molecular
formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all
compounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form
was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of
references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers
citing this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which
is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore
analogous to a CT search.
  This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so
far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of
this type.

Thesaurus Compilation Methods:  A Literature Review
.A
Blagden, J.F.
.W
  This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific
and Technical Information and the end product of the complete
research will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel research
in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being 
conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School,
and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of
Business Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the
construction of a faceted classification scheme for management,
this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing
faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.
  A study of existing information retrieval systems in the
management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt
some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparative
study of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has also
already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus,
was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield
results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of
natural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarily
because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical
collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this
discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is
certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of
management.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who
quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic
chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social
science (20 per cent).
  Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov,
Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment
available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.

Criteria for Evaluating Technical Library Effectiveness
.A
Wessel, C.J.
.W
  In July 1966 John I. Thompson & Company accepted a contract with the
Picatinny Arsenal, US Department of the Army, to perform a study aimed
at developing 'Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library
operations and services' under the ATLIS Program (Army Technical
Library Improvement Studies).  The study was divided into three
phases aimed at:
    I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the
      art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating
      libraries developed up to the present.
   II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from
      Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already
      published, or from any other sources, by which to develop
      criteria.
  III A phase in which to establish and validate the criteria.
  Phases I and II of the study are now complete.  Phase III is in progress
and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968.  The reports of
Phases I and II are already available for detailed study and that of
Phase III will be available soon.  The purpose of this paper is to present
some of the findings of the study.

The UDC in its International Aspects
.A
Lloyd, G.A.
.W
  Universal Decimal Classification - dying duck or live bird? - or some
such title - was suggested to me, but this is highly debatable, and there will
hardly be time for the duck-shooters to develop a concerted onslaught in the
half-hour or so allowed us for discussion.  Besides, I hope to be able to
convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the
UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of
its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as
it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but
that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be
gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the
distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of
users throughout the world.

Subject Relations in Science/Technology Literature
.A
Earle, P.
Vickery, B.
.W
  The analysis of citations has often been employed to indicate the use
of the literature of science and technology.  Citation is only an indicator
of use, not an accurate measure, and like all such indicators has defects.
Differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere.
  Despite these defects, an examination of citations does enable one to
sample acts of literature use within a large community.  The study reported
here was directed, in fact, to all United Kingdom authors of science/
technology publications in a given year, and because of its width, and the type
of analysis performed, is considered to be worth reporting.  The study was
primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science
literature, and this has been reported elsewhere.

Letter to the Editor:  Assessment of Information Services
.A
Davison, P.s.
.W
  May we please raise four questions which are important at the present time
when government policy on information retrieval is being considered? These
arise from results recently produced by SDC which are germane to Dr.
Somerfield's paper on 'Computer-based Information Services' (Aslib
Proceedings, 20, 12, 542-50 (1968)), and to OSTI's work in this field.
  The SDC is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published
indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results
of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study
on the subject of 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'.  This results
from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating
results of searches in twelve of the world's major indexes to chemistry and
spectroscopy, including searches of SDC's own data bank files.  Nearly
two hundred unique references on 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'
were found and are being checked individually for relevance going back
to the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary.

On the Design of Information Systems for Human Beings
.A
Line, M.B.
.W
  Planning of any kind can be motivated by a pressing practical problem which
has to be solved - for example, an increasing number of people may have to be
housed in the same area; or by a long-term idealistic vision; or by both
(the idealist seeing the long-term implications of an immediate problem).  In
short-term planning, the danger exists that the more technical problems may be
solved, without attention to their implications for human beings; to take
my housing example, higher and higher flats may be built, without considering
the possible effects (e.g. the effect on social groupings).  In long-term
planning, Utopian or ideological blueprints may be produced.

Standard Costing for Information Systems:
Background to a Current Study
.A
Robertson, S.E.
Reynolds, R.
Wilkin, A.P.
.W
  For some time past, interest has been developing within the Aslib Research
Department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information
systems.  A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R.
Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject:
such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because
of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to
describe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing
a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of
standard conventions for the analysis of information systems.
  One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for
these systems, namely:
(a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information
    systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed
    for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al).
(b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an
    attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting
    them.
  In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production
of current-awareness bulletins.  An outline of some of the preliminary work in
this project follows.

An Information Retrieval Language for MARC
.A
Austin, D.
.W
  I see from the programme that I am supposed to talk on an information  
language for MARC, and it is true that the work I have been doing for the past
year or so has been under the auspices of the MARC Project.  But the subject
indexing system we have developed is concerned as much with BNB's plans for
computer production from 1971 as with the MARC tapes as such, and I hope to
show that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatible
general system with even wider application.  Before coming to this, however, it
is necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which
caused BNB to look to the computer for help.  From this we can see how the
computer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing.

Analysis and Organization of Knowledge for Retrieval
.A
Farradane, J.E.L.
.W
  In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called 'pure' or
'basic' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications of
information science, I will prefer the word 'basic', although there is not so 
much difference.  In such research, and really in any good research, one should
not be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and,
as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are
eliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable
proportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of
hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining
evidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just 
that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible.
If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon
which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one
is ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in a
fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human
situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does
not alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodology
lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today.

User Studies:  A Review of the Literature from 1966 to 1970
.A
Wood, D.N.
.W
  My terms of reference when asked to prepare this review of user studies were
to bring Fishenden's work up to date.  This was published in the Journal of 
Documentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number
of British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the
development of a national information service.  The present paper which covers
the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  It
considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits 
of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results 
which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop
policies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Although
an increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe and
in the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the review
considers mainly British and American investigations.

Library and Information Science Abstracts: The First Two Years
.A
Gilcrist, A.
Presanis, A.
.W
  With the thirteenth issue affected by the recent postal strike, now seems
an opportune moment to take a look at the performance of LISA in its first two
years.  This bi-monthly abstracts service succeeded the former Library Science
Abstracts in 1969 as a joint venture between the Library Association and Aslib.
A recount of its birth and a brief report on early progress both appeared in
1969.

The Information Uses and Needs of Social Scientists:
An Overview of INFROSS
.A
Line, M.B.
.W
  When INFROSS began in the autumn of 1967, although a large number of
studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information,
very little had been done in the field of social science information.  There are 
a number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a much 
smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and
less inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist libraries
in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with
social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in 
scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally,
until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this
kind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had its
disadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and we
were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.  On the other hand,
we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable
studies.  There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field.

SDI:  Some Economic and Organizational Aspects
.A
Dammers, H.F.
.W
  In the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate that
I should deal specifically with the economic aspects of Selective Dissemination
of Information (SDI) operation and use.  In my opinion the technical 
feasibility and merits of SDI have been adequately demonstrated; the main
barriers hindering general use, however, tend to be of an economic nature.
  At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, an
SDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularly
since we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969.  In addition
to these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes
(prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and,
on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia.
All these tapes are searched locally, involving the running of around five
hundred profiles weekly.

The Theoretical Foundation of the IDC-system:  
Six Postulates for Information Retrieval
.A
Fugmann, Robert
.W
  Successful delegated searching for publications relevant to the topic of
an inquirer obeys rules whose relations to thermodynamics are unmistakable.
By the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and
conceptual respect, steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order
which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of
an inquirer.  If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing
requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because
the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his
available search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree of
order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the
basis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by these
postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher
are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be
made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.
  The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience
with the IDC-system and its precursors.  These postulates form the basis
of this system and of its further development.

The Future of Scientific and Technological Publications
.A
Smailes, A.A.
.W
  I am sure you do not need reminding of the flood of scientific information
that is available today and the estimates of its growth in the next two
decades.  In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Rand
corporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from
five million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and their
total productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assess
the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely
stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science
would actually be transacted.  It is these 'substantial changes' that concern
the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we
do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will
not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become
redundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be
ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regard
the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to 
opportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort out
what is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change,
select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of
the scientist to this mass of information.

Rationalization of Serial Holdings in Special Libraries
.A
Houghton, B.

Prosser, C.

   This paper describes progress which has been made toward the development of
a procedural model intended as a code of good practice to enable special 
librarians to effect economies in their journal holdings by systematically 
planned use of the BLL..
   A theoretical model suggested by B. C. Brookes was tested on various sets of 
usage data from seven special libraries but the results proved to be unrealistic
in terms of immediate provision to the user.. A new experimental approach has 
now been developed based on the total use versus total cost of a journal 
collection..

Aspects of the Theory of Syntax
.A
Chomsky, N.
.W
  The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining
the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by
no means novel.  Well over a century ago, it was expressed with 
reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but
rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt,
1836).  His view that a language "makes infinite use of finite
means" and that its grammar must describe the processes that
make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent
concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind,
with this "creative" aspect of language use (for discussion, see
Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that even
Panini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a
"generative grammar," in essentially the contemporary sense of
this term.
  This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems
that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar,
which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the
discussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how this
theory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, with
questions that are at the border of research in transformational
grammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more
often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible
approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions.

The Assault on Privacy
.A
Miller, A.R.
.W
  The genesis of this book can be traced to a telephone call I
received during the fall of 1966 from Dr. James G. Miller, then
Director of the University of Michigan's Mental Health Institute
and currently Vice President for Academic Affairs of Cleveland
State University.  He asked what I am sure he thought was a
relatively straightforward and easily answered question:  What
are the legal consequences of computerizing copyrighted materials?
On closer inquiry I discovered that Dr. Miller was exploring
the possibility of using computer technology to develop a national,
multi-media information network, that would electronically integrate
our colleges and universities, eventually providing each of them
a comprehensive and easily accessible pool of scholarly works and
educational services.  He subsequently sought to breathe life into
this idea of promoting the formation of an organization called the
Interuniversity Communications Council (EDUCOM).

An Assessment of Quality in Graduate Education
.A
Cartter, A.M.
.W
  Before this study was begun in the spring of 1964, serious deliberation
was given to the question of American Council of Education sponsorship of
an evaluation of selected graduate programs of major universities that
comprise an important segment of the Council's membership.  There was
never any question about the need for doing in a systematic and objective
way what necessarily goes on continually in any event, though usually
in a piecemeal and more impressionistic way.  Our Commission on Plans
and Objectives for Higher Education, and other leading educators consulted,
concluded that a thoroughgoing study should be made and that the Council's
aegis was a suitable one.

The Association of American Library Schools, 1915-1968:
An Analytical History
.A
Davis, D.G
.W
    The growth of professions has been one of the sociological
phenomena of the past century.  As the strength of
national professional associations of practitioners has increased,
concern with education for the professions has
prompted schools to develop standards and curricula to
support the preparation of practitioners.  During the half
century spanning 1900 the schools in many professions formed
national associations.  The Association of American Medical
Colleges, for example, was established in 1876.  Other professional
school associations followed:  engineering (1893), law (1900),
librarianship (1915), theology (1918), and social work (1919).
These associations, to cite a few, have developed in different ways
while conforming to general patterns and have reached various lvels
of influence in affecting professional education.

As We May Think
.A
Bush, V.
.W
  As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development,
Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six
thousand leading American scientists in the application of
science to warfare.  In this significant article he holds up
an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased.  He
urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task
of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.
For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than
the powers of his mind.  Trip hammers that multiply the fists,
microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and
detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern
science.  Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly
developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited
knowledge of the ages.  The perfection of these pacific instruments
should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from
their war work.  Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The
American Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship
between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. - The Editor

Authoritarian Personality
.A
Adorno, T.W.
.W
  This is a book about social discrimination.  But its purpose is not
simply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive body
of information.  The central theme of the work is a relatively new
concept - the rise of an "anthropological" species we call the
authoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older style
he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly 
industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational 
beliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud
to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others,
jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power
and authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflicting
trends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and
political thinkers.  This book approaches the problem with the means of
socio-psychological research.

Automated Language Processing
.A
Borko, H.
.W
  The idea for Automated Language Processing was suggested in 1964 at a
time when the research efforts in information storage and retrieval were
expanding at System Development Corporation.  Many people in the company
were directly interested in this area, and an even larger group had interests
that were tangentially related.  A quick and effective means of acquainting
them with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilation
of relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on the
theory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would
be a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake.
Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire
range of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole is
concerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact that
all but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either as
employees or consultants.  The single exception is Pendergraft, for SDC
has had no sustained project in machine translation.  SDC Management was
enthusiastic in its support of the new project.

Automated Keyword Classification for Information Retrieval
.A
Sparck-Jones, K.
.W
  This book is primarily a research monograph, in which the discussion
of the main topics has been broadened so that they are related to their
surrounding context in information retrieval as a whole; it is not a
textbook, and no attempt has therefore been made to justify the choice
of topic, or account for the use of certain concepts, or to provide an
elementary description of either.  For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumed
that the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information
retrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind of
retrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or that
between the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the
use of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example.  Equally,
in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means of
characterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument;
but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this,
or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which has
raged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view of
my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios.

Automation in Libraries
.A
Kimber, R.T.
.W
  My purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understanding
of what automated systems can do in libraries today.  I have limited
myself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed "library
housekeeping" - the processes of book ordering and cataloguing,
periodicals accessioning and circulation control, whose purpose is to
make a library into an efficient machine for acquiring, storing, and
disseminating knowledge and information.  These are the processes
which can be automated here and now to improve the quality of
service which a library can give to its readers.  I hope that the
descriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librarians
in developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries.

The Automation Survey: Background and Conclusions
.A
King, G.W.
.W
  During the past decade the Library of Congress, in
common with many other research libraries, has become
increasingly aware of pressures and strains in
many of its operations.  These areas of concern (well
known to librarians) include mounting arrearages in
cataloguing and other processing activities; increasing
complexity of manual inventory control files;
increasing difficulty in keeping card catalogues 
reasonably current and accurate; and
increasing demands for a wide variety of services
for a clientele whose needs for information
have grown tremendously since World War II,
and many of whom have only recently turned to
large research libraries for help.  Five years ago an
internal committee of the Library of Congress was
charged to study potential applications of electronic
data processing equipment to Library procedures;
subsequently representatives of three computer firms
made brief studies of Library operations which 
intimated that certain areas could benefit substantially
by automation.

Automated Information-Retrieval Systems (IRS)
.A
Belonogov, G.G.
.B
1973
.W
  It is easiest of all to apply mechanization and automation to the
transmission, accumulation and search of information.  Automation
can also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  In
all of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices are
analysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role of
machine is to considerably extend man's capabilities rather than to
completely replace man. 
  The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for information
have come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  These
systems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing.
The physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment,
punched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers,
the latter playing the most prominent part.

Medical School Library Statistics
.A
Keenan, E.L.
.W
  At the June 1962 Convention of the Medical Library Association in
Chicago, Illinois, Mr. Stanley Truelson, now Librarian of the University of
Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, circulated a petition
requesting the collection and publication of medical school library
statistics.  Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed the
petition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formed 
by Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group of
the Medical Library Association.
  This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself,
studied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Office
of Education.  These were rejected as not meeting the needs of our
specialized group of libraries.  As a guide for selecting the terminology
in the questionnaire, we used the American Library Association's Definitions
for Library Statistics; a Preliminary Draft (Chicago, 1961).
  After several drafts, a sample questionnaire was approved by the
committee and distributed to all the medical school libraries in the United
States and Canada.  The Canadian medical school libraries were included
as a result of communications with Miss Doreen Fraser, Librarian of the
Bio-Medical Library of the University of British Columbia and Dr. J.
Wendell McLeod of the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges.

The Contemporary Medical Society Library
.A
Crawford, Susan
Michel, Carol
Waligorski, Conrad
.W
   Four hundred sixty-eight medical societies  in the United States were
surveyed to determine those which sponsor libraries.. Seventy-eight libraries
were identified, of which eighteen are "marginal" and nine are jointly
supported by a medical school and a society, leaving fifty-one relatively
"substantial" libraries whose major support is through society membership..
Characteristics measured include size of collection, types of media, staff,
budget, services, and sources of support.. Questions are raised concerning
the role of the medical library as one institution which participates in the
continuing education of the physician..

   A survey of the circulation of books and journals  at the Downstate Medical
Center Library was conducted, based on cancelled circulation cards accumulated
during a one-year period.. Analysis of the results shows the frequency of use
of various materials by several groups of borrowers and brings out important
differences between circulation of books and that of journals.. One of the
result was the compilation of a list of most frequently used journals.. The 
findings  are graphically represented by several tables and charts..

How Biomedical Investigators Use Library Books
.A
Raisig, L. Miles
Smith, Meredith
Cuff, Renata
Kilgour, Frederick G.
.W
   Relatively few studies have been concerned with the use of biomedical
books.. This paper reports an investigation into use made of library books
by biomedical investigators.. Based on cancelled charge slips collected at the
Yale Medical Library circulation desk, telephone appointments were made to
interview those research investigators whose books has been returned the
previous day.. The interviewer obtained answers from the investigator to a
questionnaire to discover how the investigator had learned of a book, if the
book had been useful, and, if useful, how it had been used.. During the 
six-month study period, 30.4 percent of researchers' volumes returned were
monographs.. Almost four-fifths of books borrowed supplied information wanted,
and about four-fifths of books used had been printed in the previous decade..
Nine-tenths of the use of books was research-related, the other tenth being
for lecture preparation..

An Investigation of the Educational Needs of Health Sciences Library
Manpower:
  I. Definition of the Manpower Problem and Research Desing
.A
Kronick, David A.

.W
   In order to plan adequately for education in health science librarianship
and to be able to project future demands and needs we need to know a great deal
more about existing  manpower in health science libraries.. This paper, the 
first in a series of reports on an investigation to gather this data, discusses
the research methodology and the development of an inventory of the institution
program population upon which the survey is based.. An analysis in terms of 
geographic location, type (educational, research, etc.), administrative 
control, and primary cognate area of these institutions is presented, and their
distribution through the various Regional Medical Library areas is noted..
Preliminary estimates are made, based on questionnaire to the libraries, on the
size of the library population, their relationship to reporting programs or
institutions, exclusive of the hospital population which is being covered in an
independent survey.. A questionnaire to library personnel is underway which
will establish, along with the other questionnaires, a basis for exploring the
relationships which exist between institutions or programs, libraries and
manpower..

An Investigation of the Educational Needs of Health Science Library
Manpower:
  II. Health-Related Institutions and Their Library Resources
.A
Rothenberg, Lesliebeth

.W
   As part of an investigation of health sciences library manpower, the
universe of health-related institutions and programs (excluding hospitals) was
surveyed by postcard questionnaire to produce an inventory and description of
libraries providing services to these institutions reported access to library
resources, indicating usage of some 2,207 non-hospital libraries.. Eighty
percent (2,431) of the institutions reported that the library used was "within"
their own institution; 20 percent (608) noted that the library was "outside"
of their institution..
   The distribution of health-related institutions and libraries is shown by
RML districts, together with relevant census data.. A classification of
libraries, based on the degree of involvement of the libraries' facilities,
resources and personnel in supplying services to health-related institutions,
was developed..
   It is concluded that projections of manpower needs should take into account
institutions and programs not at present possessing health sciences libraries
as well as documented demand in existing health sciences libraries..

   An investigation of the manpower requirements of health sciences libraries
and of educational programs appropriate to these manpower needs was begun in 
March 1968.. To data, 4,727 libraries have been identified as being used by
14,000 health sciences institutions and programs.. Of this total, 2,628 are 
hospital libraries; 1,328 are health sciences libraries; and 771 are academic 
or public libraries..
   Within these libraries some 14,938 persons are directly involved, either
full- or part-time, in the delivery of health sciences library services.. Of
the total work force, 5,861 persons are employed in hospital libraries and
9,077 are employed in health sciences libraries and collections.. The ratio
between professional and nonprofessional employees is 1:2; professional and
nonprofessional status was assigned by the chief librarian.. Survey data
indicate a 7 percent manpower shortage in positions classified as professional,
and a 3 percent shortage in positions classified as nonprofessional..

Kronick, David A.

   A statistical description based on a mail survey of personnel in 2,099
health sciences libraries located outside of the hospital setting is reported..
Respondents to the survey were divided into three groups: professionals (those
possessing a graduate library degree); nonprofessionals (those not possessing
graduate library degree); and chief librarians (those responsible for a
library's operations).. Survey items dealt with education, sex, age, salary,
job mobility and preference for continuing education programs..
   Some 60 percent of the respondents were professionals; 40 percent were
nonprofessionals.. Seven hundred and twenty-eight chief librarians were 
identified in the population: 57 percent were professional librarians while
the remainder were without a graduate library degree.. Approximately 1/5
of all survey respondents were men.. The age distribution for the work force
tended to be bimodal, reflecting the career patterns of women and the later
entry of men into librarianship.. The annual salary for male professionals was
calculated at $12,732; for female professionals at $10,044; for male
nonprofessionals at $7,878; and for female nonprofessionals at $6,313.. Male
professionals were found to have the highest rates of job and geographic
mobility.. Conversely, female nonprofessionals were lowest in mobility.. In
expressing a preference for continuing education programs in library science,
professionals tended to request courses dealing with the organization of
libraries, health sciences institutions and their relationships, while 
nonprofessionals inclined towards courses in technical processing..

Brandon, Alfred N.
.W
   This updated list of 410 books and 136 journals is intended as a selection
aid for the small library of a hospital, medical society, clinic, or similar
organization.. Books and journals are arranged by subject, with the books 
followed by an author index, and the journals by an alphabetical title 
listing.. Items suggested for first purchase by smaller libraries are noted by
an asterisk..
   To purchase the entire collection of books and to pay for the annual
subscription costs of all the journals would require an expenditure of about
12,000.. To acquire only those items suggested for first purchase,
approximately $3,250 would be needed..

MEDLINE Evaluation Study
.A
Moll, Wilhelm
.W
   MEDLINE (MEDLARS-ON-LINE) is the new on-line, interactive bibliographic
searching system which was recently developed by the National Library of 
Medicine.. The system provides users with lists of bibliographical citations
and other information from a three-year file of over 1,250 biomedical
journals.. A survey testing user reactions was conducted at the University of
Virginia Medical Library.. The results of the survey are based on replies by
246 users who requested one or more MEDLINE searches between September 1972 and
March 1973.. The findings indicate that over 93% believe that MEDLINE is a 
substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through the
printed indexes.. These respondents also stated that the results of MEDLINE
searches had assisted them in their clinical or research work, or both.. Asked
whether they would continue to use MEDLINE after the imposition of user charges
on July 1, 1973, about 75% said that they would.. The remaining 25% expressed
some reservation and doubts.. The survey gives reason to believe that with the
imposition of user charges the use of MEDLINE will decline..

   ***MEDLEARN***, an orientation to MEDLINE, was developed to educate members
of the biomedical community to become competent on-line searchers.. It appears
in two complementary forms: an interactive terminal presentation available on
the TYMSHARE Network and a supporting hard-copy manual which contains the
didactic portions of the computer program as well as additional items which are
not suitable for on-line presentation.. ***MEDLEARN***, a flexible instruction
tool, is divided into forty sections which may be selected in various sequences
depending on the user's previous experience.. Two MEDLINE simulations and
feedback sections after practice on MEDLINE provide motivation for continued
learning.. The orientation program was evaluated at several medical centers
with uniformly favorable results..

A Cooperative Serial Acquisition Program: Thoughts on a Response to
Mounting Fiscal Pressures
.A
Jones, C. Lee
.W
   A regionally cooperative method of distributing responsibility for every
serial title in a region is outlined.. The system assures the equitable
distribution of the number of titles for which each library is committed..
Later refinements suggest an equalization of cost commitments on the basis of
fiscal resources available for serial purchases.. It is pointed out that fiscal
realities will force some sort of serial acquisition cooperation for all viable
medical libraries..

Use of Medical and Biological Journals in the Yale Medical Library
.A
Kilgour, F.G.
.W
  This paper presents data for the end of 1960 on recorded use of some
two hundred of the most often used scientific and medical journals in the
Yale Medical Library.  The investigation was designed to identify the most
abundantly used titles of recent date of publication to guide the 
acquisition of multiple subscriptions.  At the same time data was collected
to distinguish heavily used back sets.

The Evaluation of Published Indexes and Abstract Journals:
      Criteria and Possible Procedures
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
   This paper describes possible criteria by which the effectiveness of a
published index  may be evaluated and suggest procedures that might be used to
conduct an evaluation of a published index.. The procedures were developed for
the National Library of Medicine and relate specifically to the recurring
bibliographies produced by MEDLARS in various specialized areas of
biomedicine.. The methods described should, however, be applicable to other
printed indexes and abstract journals..
   Factors affecting the performance  of a published index are also discussed
and some research projects relevant to the evaluation of published indexes are
reviewed..

World Biomedical Journals, 1951-60:
     A Study of the Relative Significance of 1,388 Titles Indexed in
     Current List of Medical Literature
.A
Raisig, L. Miles
.W
   This study is an application of the relationship of serial articles
published to serial articles cited, developed in theory in the author's
"Statistical Bibliography in the Health Sciences" (BULLETIN 50: 450-461,
July 1962).. A ranked list of the indexes of significance of most of the
serials indexed in Current List of Medical Literature was derived and erected
from 21,000 citations secured in a random sampling of 1962 and 1961 biomedical
journals regularly received in the Yale Medical Library.. The author measures
the gross indexing effectiveness of Current List against his indexes of 
significance , offers his method  and results as means to reach objective
standards for indexing and abstracting, and projects his results  as measures
of general value of the serials analyzed..

.A
Moll, Wilhelm
.W
   This Basic Journal List of forty-eight journal titles is intended as a 
selection guide for the librarian of the small hospitals.. It is based on a
survey of physicians in Virginia who were asked to review journal titles
contained in the 1967 edition of a list compiled by Mr. Alfred N. Brandon..
The List is designed for the library in a hospital of from 100 to 300 beds and
for the active clinician..

AIM-TWX service at the University of Virginia:
       A Review and Evaluation
.A
Moll, Wilhelm
.W
   The paper reviews the highlights of a four-week trial period (November 19 -
December 18, 1970) during which the Medical Library of the University of
Virginia experimented with a new remote-access bibliographical control and
retrieval system via its TWX machine.. The system, called AIM-TWX, was
sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications
and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California..
Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, including
those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved
either on- or off-line..
   Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of
staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH
vocabulary which is the principle "language" of the man-computer dialog..
   The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately
200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run
on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an 
inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose
training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was
highly successful in terms of searches and citations..
   At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors,
and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no 
citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest
among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large
number of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginia
participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand
for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with
great rapidity..

Choosing Physiology Journals
.A
Brodman, E.
.W
  For many years administrators of library collections have sought
objective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections
in the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearest
approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge
of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  This
method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at
the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under
consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the
frequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the 
references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and
a list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Gross
and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the
American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library
to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry.
  Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty
years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have
never been examined.  These assumptions are:
1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct
   proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional
   literature.
2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are
   representative of the entire field.
3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted
   equally.

Statistical Bibliography in the Health Sciences
.A
Raisig, L.M.
.W
  The sustained interest in documentation, as a key to the retrieval of
information in the literature of the sciences, has obscured largely the
potential utility of statistical bibliography as a method of analyzing
information needs.  In the belief that a discussion of the latter may be
of value to interested biomedical librarians and scientists, a review of
investigative methods and results in the health sciences is offered here.
  Statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretation
of statistics relating to books and periodicals; it may be used in a
variety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements.
Within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collected
and explained in several fields of science for these main purposes: to
demonstrate historical movements, to determine the national or universal
research use of books and journals, and to ascertain in many local
situations the general use of books and journals.

Mechanization of Library Procedures in the Medium-sized Medical Library
.A
Pizer, I.H.
Franz, D.R.
Brodman, E.
.W
  Mechanical means for expediting library work have been considered
for many years, as an examination of the early pages of Library
Journals bears out. The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin,
the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained an
article on the use of the "typewriting machine" in cataloging.  Telephones
have long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusual
items, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books.
  Nevertheless, when the term "machine methods" is used for libraries
today, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronic
equipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to afford
such equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but the
largest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library of
Medicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanical
methods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations.

Moderately and Heavily Used Biomedical Journals
.A
Fleming, Thomas P.
.A
Kilgour, Frederick G.
.W
   The purpose of this investigation was to produce a title list of current
journals suppling upwards of 75 percent of demand at the Columbia and Yale 
Medical Libraries.. Columbia received nearly 2,000 journals and Yale over
1,500; findings are based upon an analysis of canceled charge slips for issues
published from 1959 through June 1962.. This combined study of recorded usage
for six months in the Columbia Medical Library (12.9 percent of circulation
during January through June 1962) and for one year in the Yale Medical Library
(12.5 percent of 1961/62 circulation) revealed that a core of 262 journals
supplied 80 percent of use of titles published in the 1959 to mid-1962
period.. However, it is probable that current issues of all titles received
were used at least once within the libraries.. Titles of sixty-seven journals
which supplied slightly more than 50 percent of use are listed..

Medical Libraries and the Assessment of User Needs
.A
Rees, Alan M.
.W
   Users of information in science and technology have been studied in great
detail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading and
searching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probing
for this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and 
unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires..
   Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow,
the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction
produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the
extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon the
response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs,
since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of 
underlying information needs..
   Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system
must, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of
biomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which
can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors..
Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals
such as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect to
environment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical
practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their
colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical
schools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..
   It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in a
methodology which will permit the determination and prediction of the
information needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment..

Analysis of Recorded Biomedical Book and Journal Use in the Yale Medical
Library
Part I. Date and Subject Relations
.A
Stangl, Peter

Kilgour, Frederick G.
.W
   Analysis of book and journal circulation is based on cancelled charge slips
collected over a one-year period in the Yale Medical Library.. About two-fifths
of material circulated	were monographs.. Books and journals in seven subject
fields provided over half of the circulation.. Approximately two-thirds of both
books and journals used had been published during the most recent nine years..
A subject-by-subject examination of the ratio of books to journals circulating
revealed that, in subject where proportionally more journals than books were
taken out of the Library, books were of more recent imprint dates than were
journals, contrary to the overall pattern.. Date distribution of books and
journals by subject was also studied.. Results are illustrated with graphs and
tables..

   Cancelled charge slips collected over a one-year period supply the data for
this analysis of circulation in the Yale Medical Library.. Full-time teacher
faculty are the heaviest users of journal literature, and  students, of
monograph literature.. Faculties of Medical School departments are compared in
terms of their use of material in individual subjects.. Subject literatures are
analyzed in terms of groups of users borrowing from them.. The extent to which
journal titles used by medical students  are also used by Medical School
faculty is examined.. One of the products of the study is a rank list of 
journal titles used in the Library.. Results are presented in several tables..

The Circulation Analysis of Serial Use:  Numbers Game or Key to Service?
.A
Raisig, Miles L.
.W
   The conventionally erected and reported circulation analysis of serial use
in the individual and the feeder library is found to be statistically invalid
and misleading, since it measures neither the intellectual use of the serial's
contents nor the physical handlings or serial units, and is nonrepresentative
of the in-depth library use of serials.. It fails utterly to report or even to
suggest the relation of intralibrary and interlibrary serial resources.. The
actual mechanics of the serial use analysis, and the active variables in the
library situation which affect serial use, are demonstrated in a simulated
analysis and are explained at length.. A positive design is offered for the
objective gathering and reporting of data on the local intellectual use and
physical handling of serials and the relating of resources.. Data gathering in
the feeder library, and implications for the extension of the feeder library's
resources, are discussed..

   In July 1966, the Institute for Advancement of Medical Communication began
work on a project aimed at developing methods for collecting objective data
suitable for planning and guiding local, regional, and national programs to 
improve biomedical libraries and the biomedical information complex.. This
article constitutes an introduction to a series of reports on the methodologic
tools that have been developed.. It describes the overall purpose and initial 
goals of the project, gives the general plan of the work, and presents five
basic concepts that underlie the project's approach and structure the entire
effort..

Development of Methodologic Tools for Planning and
Managing Library Services:
II. Measuring a Library's Capability for Providing Documents

   A method of measuring a library's capability for providing the documents its
users need has been developed.. The library is tested with representative 
sample of such documents to determine how long would be required for users to
obtain these documents.. Test results are expressed in terms of a Capability
Index, which has a maximal value of 100 only if all the sample documents are
found "on shelf".. Specific tests employing samples of 300 documents have been
developed that are appropriate for academic an for "reservoir" biomedical
libraries.. Realistic field trials have demonstrated that these two tests are
practical to administer and that test results are adequately reproducible..
When strict comparability is not important, a library can test itself.. In
assessing a reservoir library, test results are supplemented by data on its
typical processing time for interlibrary loan requests.. Currently these tests
are being used in a national survey.. The general method is applicable to other
types of libraries, provided appropriate test samples are established.. If 
their limitations are clearly understood, these "Document Delivery Tests"
can be valuable tools for planning and managing library services..

   A standardized procedure was developed for eliciting those details for a
library's service policies that are important to its users and for recording
the data by checking appropriate categories on a form.. This inventory 
procedure covers the entire spectrum of user services and accommodates a wide
range of policies.. The inventory was originally designed for use by trained
interviewers in large-scale surveys of academic medical libraries.. However,
it is also suitable for other kinds of libraries, and the Interview Guide and
Checklist can be used for a self-survey by library stuff.. In addition to 
survey use, the inventory has a variety of educational, administrative,
managerial, and research applications.. A methods for weighting the categorical
inventory data to reflect the relative desirability of different policies makes 
it possible to calculate scores indicating how a library's policies compare
with those of an "optimal" library.. An analogous inventory of the services a 
library provides to other libraries was developed for surveying major backup
resources in the medical library system..

Survey of the Card Catalog in Medical Libraries
.A
Pachefsky, Reva
.W
   A survey of present uses and arrangement of medical library card catalogs 
was made in order to determine current practices and trends.. Attention was
focused on the influences of MeSH on the card catalog.. The results indicate
that the prevalent type of card catalog found in medical libraries is the 
divided catalog.. In addition, it appears that this catalog arrangement is 
gaining acceptance, and the trend is toward division.. MeSH has an effect on 
the organization of the card catalog; libraries indicate that it is an 
influential factor in the decision to divide the catalog..

   This paper reports the results of a four-week questionnaire survey carried 
out at the National Lending Library (N.L.L.), Great Britian, to discover which
types of organizations were the principal users of medical literature, what 
types of literature were used, and which were the main sources of references
to medical publications..Industrial organizations and universities accounted
for the majority (62 percent) of the loans, most of which were English-language
periodicals published since 1960.. For the whole sample, citation list in 
periodical articles were the principal sources of references, although for
literature published in the last fifteen months, abstracting and indexing
journals were the main sources.. Of the latter, Index Medicus proved to be the
most fruitful source of references.. By asking whether the item requested was
really useful to their work, a measure of the reliability of the different
sources of references was obtained..
   Appendixes include the questionnaire, a list of the most frequently borrowed
journals, and a list of abstracting and indexing journals used as sources of
references..

Thesaural Problems in an On-Line System
.A
Cain, Alexander M.
.W
   This paper describes the construction of a synonym thesaurus or entry 
vocabulary for the SUNY Biomedical Communication Network, which will permit
the user greater ease of access to MeSH-indexed material without previously
consulting a printed list of indexed terms.. In order to discover the actual
terminalogy used by a researcher, words were extracted from titles of articles
appearing in Index Medicus, and compared with the subject heading under which
they appeared.. As well as strict synonyms, grammatical variants were also 
included.. Work is continuing on relating other indexing vocabularies, such as
Excerpta Medica and Current Medical Terminalogy, used in the biomedical world 
to MeSH terms..

The Role of the Medical Librarian in SDI Systems
.A
Garfield, Eugene
.W
   Many ongoing selective dissemination systems designers assume that the 
librarian can be omitted from active participation in execution of the master
plan.. ISI's four years of experience with ASCA service have shown that 
librarians must be an integral part of the system and engage in a active 
dialogue between users and the machine.. Specific examples of how 
librarians can best serve the information needs of scientists using SDI systems
are examined.. It is the basic contention of this paper that the librarian
should serve as an intermediary between users and the numerous new information
media.. In this manner the librarian can filter and translate the requirements
of individual scientists to conform with the inherent limitations of all
machine systems while exploiting their capabilities to the fullest..

   This annotated list of 178 items is compiled as a guide to the development
of the reference collection in a small medical library..
   Arrangement, following the pattern of the previous revision, is by broad 
subject groups.. Titles are chiefly in English.. Textbooks in subject fields
have been omitted since these are covered adequately in several comprehensive
guides to the literature..

Coordination of Regional Libraries with Regional Medical Program Projects
.A
Kefauver, David F.
.W
   The Medical Library Assistance Act authorized the Regional Medical Library 
Program to improve information services in health fields, as well as other
programs designed to help the health worker.. Both the RMLP and the Regional
Medical Program are based on regional cooperation to enhance the value of 
available resources, and to enable health workers away from main centers to 
use them.. Services with Regional Medical Libraries must supply are described..
As this program develops, more than conventional library services will be
provided..
  Regional Medical Programs stress the continuing education of health-related
personnel, and their need for health information; libraries are necessarily
involved in such programs.. The regions of the RMP are smaller than those of 
the RMLP, and the smaller regional focus may be an advantage..
   Specific examples of the coordination of library services and library-
oriented programs are given..

User Services Offered By Medical School Libraries in 1968:
Results of a National Survey Employing New Methodology

   The breadth and depth of services that ninety-two medical school libraries
offer to individual user were ascertained by interviewing the heads of these
libraries, employing a standardized inventory procedure developed earlier
(Bulletin 56:380-403, Oct.1968).. Selected aspects of the descriptive data 
obtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and 
commented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest 
that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the 
past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of 
service, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of
services.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the 
descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; the
weighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians
to reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services..
One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall services
relative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a single
figure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to 
87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some 
exploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find 
explanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographical
regions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the survey
data for managerial and research purposes are discussed.. One of the most
important of these uses is in establishing and implementing standards - 
activities which should be carried out by the library profession itself - and
recommendations are made for a program of such activities that is appropriate 
for the Medical Library Association..

The National Biomedical Communications Network as a Developing Structure
.A
Davis, Ruth M.
.W
   The National Biomedical Communications Network has evolved both from a set 
of conceptual recommendations over the last twelve years and an accumulation
of needs manifesting themselves in the requests of members of the medical 
community.. With a short history of three years this network and its developing
structure have exhibited most of the stresses of technology interfacing with
customer groups, and of a structure attempting to build itself upon many 
existing fragmentary unconnected segments of a potentially viable resource-
sharing capability..
   In addition to addressing these topics, the paper treats a design appropriate
to any network devoted to information transfer in a special interest user
community.. It discusses fundamentals of network design, highlighting that
network structure most appropriate to a national information network.. Examples
are given of cost analyses of information services and certain conjectures are
offered concerning the roles of national networks..

The Medical Library Assistance Act: 
An Analysis of the NLM Extramural Programs, 1965-1970
.A
Cummings, Martin M.
.A
Corning, Mary E.
.W
   The imbalance between medical library resources and information needs of the
health professional led to a reexamination of the mandate for the National 
Library of Medicine.. Legislation known as the Medical Library Assistance Act
(MLAA) was passed in 1965 which enabled the NLM to (1) initiate programs to 
assist the nation's medical libraries and (2) develop a medical library network
with the establishment of regional medical libraries to link the NLM with local
institutions..
   The National Library of Medicine, through the MLAA, has made available $40.8
million to the medical library community under a competitive grant and contract 
mechanism for the period July 1965 - June 1970.. A total of 604 projects has 
been executed in resources, research and development, training, construction,
regional medical libraries, publications, and special scientific projects.. An
assessment is given of each of these programs and their impact on both the 
National Library of Medicine and individual medical libraries.. In the 
aggregate, these programs have significantly improved library and information
services to the professional health user.. The principal limitation has been
inadequate funding to accomplish the level of originally stated objectives..

Review of Criteria Used to Measure Library Effectiveness
.A
Evans, Edward
.A
Borko, Harold
.A
Ferguson, Patricia
.W
   This article reports the results of survey of literature on measures of 
library effectiveness.. This survey led to the formulation of six criterion 
concepts  (accessibility, cost, user satisfaction, response time, cost/benefit
ratio and use).. The advantages and disadvantages of each method of 
measurement are discussed.. Several points which became clear during the 
analysis are discussed.. First, there is a relative lack of concern with the 
rationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably lead
to a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the 
purpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarely 
considered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation rather
than as part of the whole.. Third, the library's preservation function has not
been considered at all..

Document Delivery Capabilities of Major Biomedical Libraries in 1968:
Results of a National Survey Employing Standardized Tests
.A
Orr, Richard H.
.A
Schless, Arthur P.
.W
   The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin
56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-two
medical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical 
researchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling 
I-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarized 
as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in
the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the 
mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents..
A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library,
as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded
by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, 
processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain
realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular 
library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables 
can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status 
statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions 
of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this 
work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision 
aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and 
further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical

The Implementation, Evaluation, and Refinement of a Manual SDI Service 
.A
Yunis, Susan S.
.W
   The Missouri Institute of Psychiatry Library has implemented an inexpensive,
manual SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) service based upon the 
monthly issues of Index Medicus.. The implementation and refinement of the 
system are documented, and the very favorable response to the system is 
examined.. The SDI service is compared to Current Contents, with the finding
that 60 percent of the SDI participants prefer it to Current Contents.. For
this select portion of researchers the Index Medicus SDI is the more suitable
mode of current awareness.. For a significant portion of the MIP staff, 
however, the score of Index Medicus is too restricted to suitable replace 
Current Contents.. All SDI users find it highly acceptable curent awareness 
service for use in addition to Current Contents and have indicated the desire 
to continue participation in the service..

A Method of Estimating the In-House Use of the Periodical Collection in the
University of Minnesota Bio-Medical Library
.A
Tibbetts, Pamela
.W
   During two one-week periods in April 1972, information on periodical title 
and date was gathered from  periodicals collected from study and reshelving 
tables of the University of Minnesota Bio-Medical Library.
   It was determined that: (1) a few titles accounted for most of the total 
use; (2) the relationship between age and amount of use of a journal may be
described by the equation y = ke**(-bx); and (3) the last five years of 
publication accounted for 58% of the total use.

A Behavioral Approach to Historical Analysis
.A
Berkhofer, R.F.
.W
  To issue a clarion call for historians to adopt a behavioral
approach to their subject may seem as up-to-date and exciting as
last month's newspaper, for it is the academic fashion today to
argue the utility of social science theory in the writing of
history.  Books and articles issue forth from the presses in
seeming profusion advocating and even occasionally demonstrating
such an approach.  Yet these many pages fail in three significant
ways to accomplish the end they nominally espouse and which I urge.

A Behavioral Theory of the Firm
.A
Cyert, R.M.
.W
  This book is about the business firm and the way it makes 
economic decisions.  We propose to make detailed observations
of the procedures by which firms make decisions and
to use these observations as a basis for a theory of decision
making within business organizations.  Our articles of faith
are simple.  We believe that, in order to understand contemporary
economic decision making, we need to supplement
the study of market factors with an examination of
the internal operation of the firm - to study the effects of
organizational structure and conventional practice on the
development of goals, the formation of expectations, and
the execution of choices.

A Mathematical Theory of Communication
.A
Shannon, C.E.
.W
  The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM
and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has
intensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis for
such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley
on this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a
number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and
the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message
and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.
  The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at
one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another
point.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are 
correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual
entities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the
engineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message is
one selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designed
to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually
be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.

A Mathematical Theory of Communication
.A
Shannon, C.E.
.W
  In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the
signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with
the discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent the
continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete
case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite
number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on
a discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in
general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  There
are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of
emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to
particular cases.
  We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with
the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since
this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would
obscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however,
indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and
rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and
many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the
present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest.

Bibliographic Control of Nonprint Media

  Educational systems specialists lament the
deplorable lack of organization of nonprint
media for utilization in the learning process.
Audiovisual personnel have, out of despair,
made a painful entry into the world of
bibliography while librarians, long experienced
in the bibliographic control of printed matter,
still appear preoccupied with more conventional
forms of information and reluctant to turn
their expertise to the organization of nonprint
media.

On a Class of Skew Distribution Functions
.A
Simon, H.A.
.W
  It is the purpose of this paper to analyse a class of distribution
functions that appears in a wide range of empirical data - particularly
data describing sociological, biological and economic phenomena.  Its
appearance is so frequent, and the phenomena in which it appears so diverse,
that one is led to the conjecture that if these phenomena have any property
in common it can only be a similarity in the structure of the underlying

Book Availability and the Library User
.A
Buckland, M.K.
.W
  The essentially logistical problem of making library books physically
available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship.  This
book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such
it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of
solutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical
analysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding
of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  The
fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the
insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to
a better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved library
services.

Book Catalogs
.A
Tauber, M.F.
.W
  In the intervening years since the appearance of the
first collection of papers concerning book catalogs (Kingery,
Robert E., and Tauber, Maurice F., Book Catalogs, N.Y.,
The Scarecrow Press, 1963), attention has been concentrated
on the book catalog as a substitute for, or an auxiliary
to the card catalog.
  This selection of papers has identified some of the
efforts to solve particular problems concerned with book
catalogs.  The published papers, as well as those which
have been written specifically for this volume, bring additional
observations concerning the place of the book catalog in
library services.

Book Publishing:  What it Is, What it Does
.A
Dessauer, J.P.
.W
  We speak of book publishing as an industry and as a profession.
Both designations are certainly appropriate.  Book publishing is
a business conducted, for the most part, for profit.  But its
practitioners - at least those who do it honor - have
motivations that transcend their profit interest.  They know
that books are no mere commodity, no mere items for consumption that
leave their readers much as they find them.  Books, like other vehicles of
information and sources of entertainment can change, influence, elevate,
demean, exalt, or depress those who expose themselves to them.	What
books are and can be depends heavily on the judgement, integrity, taste,
and acumen of those who select and produce them - their publishers.

Book Selection of Censorship
.A
Fiske, M.
.W
  The key question was whether restrictions are being imposed on
librarians, or whether they are imposing restrictions on themselves, that
threaten the citizen's right to easy access to as adequate a collection of
books and periodicals as his community, his country or his state can
afford.  Readers of this report may come to different conclusions about
the "right" answer to this question, but whether they conclude that
librarians are or are not being as forceful as they might be in developing
and upholding freedom-to-read principles, it should not be forgotten
that it is librarians themselves who have had the courage to provide the
evidence.

Book Selection and Censorship
.A
Moon, E.
.W
  When is a librarian's decision not to include a book in his library
collection an act of book selection, and when is it censorship?  Is there, 
in fact, any discernible difference in the two terms: book selection and
censorship?  This topic was discussed so lucidly and ably, long ago, by
Lester Asheim in what has become a classic essay in the literature of
librarianship, "Not Censorship, but Selection," that raising it again
may appear to be an exercise in redundancy.

  This is the second book based on studies into social aspects 
of book reading.
  The present book is largely a report on work which was
carried out in 1967-68 but either not analysed or written
up in time for the first book, or work actually carried out
and analysed during the second year's research.  The reader
of this book will find it useful to have read the first book,
but the present book is self-contained and does not require
reference to the first one.

Books for Junior College Libraries

Ririe, J.W.

  The primary purpose of this publication is to serve as a
book selection guide for junior and community college
libraries, whether long established, newly established, or
in the planning and preinstruction stage.  The need for a
new and authoritative book list has long been expressed
by administrators, faculty members, and librarians.  It is
hoped that the present list will meet this need, and that
it will also be useful in four-year colleges, with special
reference to their lower-division work; in secondary
schools, especially where accelerated and honors programs
or courses for advanced college placement are offered;
and in public libraries seeking to satisfy the demands of
high school and college students.

A Brief guide to Sources of Scientific and Technical Information
.A
Hermer, S.
.W
  This guide is a recapitulation and refinement of the substantive
content of a one-and-a-half day course which was given before
three groups of Federal scientists and engineers during the Fall of
1967.  Its purpose was to train and inform
working scientists and engineers as to the most direct and efficient
means of seeking and acquiring work-related information.
  The impetus for the course was the recognition of the growing
need for working scientists and engineers to share and participate
in the existing and emerging information tools and mechanisms,
and to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the newer
approaches to information collection, organization, and dissemination. 
A further, related purpose of the course was to facilitate the
fullest possible participation of the working scientist and engineer 
in the evolution of information services and mechanisms which are
likely to have a greater and greater effect on his professional
activities.

Building Library Collections
.A
Carter, M.D.
.W
  Each year thousands of books are published by the
general, the technical, the governmental and the university
presses in this and other countries.  From this overwhelming
mass of new publications every library must, within the limit
of its funds, select that small part which will be most 
beneficial to the community it serves.  This is properly an
awesome responsibility to the young inexperienced librarian.  To
the competent veteran it is a task which though carried on
week after week never can approach the ease of a well
mastered routine.  Each book examined requires the exercise
of careful judgement, integrity, emotional control at times,
and scrupulous honesty, guided always by a sense of purpose.

CAN/DI system:  User reaction to a computer and information
retrieval system for Canadian scientists and technologists
.A
Wolters, P.H.
Brown, J.E.

  In April 1970, the CAN/SDI project, developed
by the Canadian National Science Library,
completed its first year of operation.  At that
time the project, designed as a national service
to alert scientists and technologists to current
information in specific fields of research, was
serving over six hundred and fifty subscribers
requiring a total of more than three thousand
five hundred individual computer queries.  Over
one thousand personalized bibliographies are
prepared each week from commercially available
data bases purchased from Chemical
Abstracts Service, the Institute for Scientific
Information (ISI) and the British Institution of
Electrical Engineers.  A detailed description of
the service was given in a paper by J.E.
Brown published in October 1969.

Case Studies in Library Computer Systems
.A
Palmer, R.P.
.W
  Case Studies in Library Computer Systems does not follow the mode of
the other volumes in this series because none of the persons, libraries or
systems is disguised.  Neither has information been withheld to force readers
tp explore alternative choices, as in the usual case method.  Rather, all
systems are identified and described as accurately as possible.  Descriptive
case studies are problem-oriented, however, because they analyze a situation
in which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfully
utilized to solve the problem at hand.  The descriptive case method rather
than the problem case method was chosen because it seemed important to
describe each system in detail and to evaluate its performance in the context
of a real library environment and against the background of particular
institutional service objectives.

Case Studies in Systems Analysis in a University Library
.A
Burkhalter, B.R.
Muller, R.
.W
  The marriage between the University of Michigan Library and
Community Systems Foundation seemed like a sensible step at the
time.  Too often, Library administration found it necessary to choose
between alternate courses of action without having adequate information.
In addition, overburdened department heads rarely found time
to alter their systems substantially to accommodate demands on the
library and their departments, let alone time to make these changes
in a systematic manner which considered the impact on other
departments and carefully weighed alternative solutions.  As a
consequence of this situation, the library administrators were
considering ways of providing staff assistance to themselves and
the department heads, so that alternate courses of action could
be designed and properly evaluated.

.W
  The present study was undertaken pursuant to an assignment
by the Library of Congress.  The author was directed to prepare,
for the Board on Cataloging Policy and Research of the A.L.A.
Division of Cataloging and Classification, a general analysis of the
ALA cataloging rules for author and title entry, with special 
consideration of the rules for corporate authors, and a discussion 
of the objectives and principles which should underlie a revision of the
rules.  The first three parts of the report are directed, respectively,
to the three aspects of this assignment.  The fourth part of the report
was added to deal with general questions raised by readers of a 
preliminary draft of this report.

Cataloging U.S.A.
.A
Dunkin, P.S.
.W
  The book deals almost entirely with theory and principles.  Only
now and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding of
the implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly 
described.
  It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry and
description, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, or
other similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on such
works, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few of
what seem to be the most important aspects of each.
  Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States.
Many interesting practices have always been part of cataloging
abroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken several
books.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seems
necessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If a
reader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful,
that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging.
I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in this
country will be of value in other countries with other conditions.  In
no sense is this a book of American intellectual imperialism.

  The papers in this publication represent the edited oral presentations of
the speakers at the conference.
  The conference theme centered on the implications of cable television for
libraries.  The general purpose of the Institute was to foster greater
understanding about the subject of cable television in the conference
participants.  More specifically, the planning committee for the conference
enumerated the following objectives:
1.  to provide an atmosphere of inquiry focused on the implications of cable
    television for libraries;
2.  to provide consultants and resource people who have knowledge and 
    experience related to the potential of cable television and its implications
    for libraries;
3.  to expand the participants' understandings and perceptions of the
    technology of cable television and its related equipment as they affect the 
    libraries' communications responsibilities;
4.  to suggest some techniques for utilizing cable television in originating 
    local programs, and to explore the possibilities for the varieties of
    services cable television can offer the profession;
5.  to aid librarians in all types of libraries to become aware of the unique
    possibilities for the utilization of cable television in their specific 
    types of libraries, and also to suggest the importance of cable television
    in a systematic approach to library and information networks; and,
6.  to create a growing and continuing consciousness of the problems and
    opportunities for the utilization of cable television in libraries.

Centralized Processing for Academic Libraries; final report of the
Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center; the first six
months of operation
.A
Doughtery, R.M.
.W
    This is the final report of the Colorado Academic
Libraries Book Processing Center (CALBPC)
project.  The CALBPC project was begun in 1965
by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort
to establish a centralized acquisition and processing
center.  The report of Phase I-II, completed
in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility
study, the design of the central system, costs
of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a
number of related concerns such as accounting, the
congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward
library services.
    This report focuses on the experimental operations
which were concluded officially on September 30,
1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the
theory and principles upon which a system might
be based, we are presently concerned with the
pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles 
encountered, and the solutions achieved.
    Although this report deals primarily with
cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe
it also contributes to a better understanding of
cooperative programs.  The experiment was designed
to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/
cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurements
were made on most internal and external aspects
of the system.  Monitoring also extended into
the participating libraries where a product
acceptance study was conducted.  A secondary
objective of the project was to observe the 
relationships which formed between the participants
and the central agency, such as the interface of
systems and the human interaction of participants
and the Center.

Carl H. Milam and the American Library Association
.A
Sullivan, P.
.W
  Carl Hastings Milam spent the most productive years of his life in
the positions with which his name is most closely associated, those
of secretary and, later, executive secretary of the American
Library Association (ALA) from 1920 to 1948.  When he became
secretary, the association had already been in existence for forty-
four years.  What kind of association was it that claimed Milam's
allegiance? What experience had he had with ALA before becoming
its secretary?  The answers to these questions lead to better
understanding of Milam, the association, and their close relationship.

  Chemical Abstracts Service, along with the entire ACS publications
program, is converting to a computer base.  This change in our basic method
of handling information will provide powerful new tools for chemists and
chemical engineers to meet their information needs.
  Our goal is a unified system that will produce both a full, printed record
of chemical and chemical engineering knowledge and a variety of timely,
special-subject alerting services, simultaneously providing a mechanized
match and retrieval system that is sufficiently flexible to meet the varied
needs of information users.  The output will be supplied in whatever form
best suits the user's needs - printed pages, microfilm, or computer-searchable
tapes.  Tapes and search programs will be usable on the customer's computer,
or CAS will provide custom matches of its own computer files.

  Abstracts of scientific papers from
journals and other serial publications,
which now make up about 85% of
the abstracts in CA, increased at an
average annual rate of 8.4% between
1961 and 1970, compared with 8.2% in 
the previous decade.  The number of
such abstracts published annually
now is doubling every 9 years.  The
number of patent abstracts increased 
at an average rate of 5% per year in
the 1960's compared with 11.7% in the
1950's.  However, the total number of
patents covered by CA, either by
actual abstracts or through the CA
patent concordance, grew at an
average rate of 10.9% from 1961 
through 1970.

Chemical Information Systems
.A
Hyde, E.
Ash, J.E.
.W
  The purpose of a chemical information system must not be restricted
to the storage and retrieval of facts.  It is equally important that the system
shall provide methods which enable a scientist to assemble and to correlate
the facts.  Chemical information systems are required primarily as a service
to research chemists to enable them to keep up to date with current
developments in their fields of interest, and the establishment of information
services has relieved the chemist of many of his problems of literature
searching and information storage and organization.

What do Chemists Read?

Reuben, B.G.

  Most British universities are spending at least 3000 pounds per year
on chemical journals alone.  And this does not include any administration
or binding costs which may be as much again.  Are the universities getting
their money's worth out of these journals?  This survey of one particular
chemistry department suggests that they are not.

The Civic Culture
.A
Almond, G.A.

  We are concerned in this book with a number of classic themes
of political science: with what the Greeks called civic virtue and its
consequences for the effectiveness and stability of the democratic
polity; and with the kind of community life, social organization, and
upbringing of children that fosters civic virtue.  In using survey
research to study these classic themes, we are also following the
traditional practice of relying on the most precise methods available to
us for the investigation of these problems.  Perhaps Tocqueville and
Bryce, were they living today, would have relied somewhat on
the cross-section survey in their comparative studies of democratic
attitudes.

Classification for a General Index Language
.A
Foskett, D.J.
.W
  The role of classification schemes in libraries and information services
has probably caused more argument than any other professional activity.
This would be surprising if classification were no more than a fairly
convenient way of arranging books on shelves.  Some librarians think it is,
and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who, like the
Classification Research Group, actually spend years of their time in
theoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse and
difficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise.
Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library
scene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the Decimal
Classification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography)
for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians,
and still more information officers, are busy revising the Universal
Decimal Classification in order to make it more detailed.  In the next
field, as it were, computerized indexing and retrieval systems are pounding
away at the ever-growing masses of literature, producing results that
impress computer specialists but not information users, who are so 
deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new.

Classification and Indexing in Science

  The first problem, that of learning of a publication's existence, is
tackled by a multiplicity of abstracting and indexing journals and
other bibliographies, and, at local levels, by library catalogues and
unnecessary overlapping among these services, while ensuring
adequately comprehensive coverage, are very great.  But even if
these were overcome, problems of the internal arrangement of these
bibliographical aids would still remain.  It is not enough for them
collectively to record every scientific publication.  The user must be
able to find every such record, starting only with a subject on which
he wants information.

  The preface to the first edition of this book - which is reproduced
following this - shows that in 1958 the classification ideas in it
were felt to be controversial, needing to be championed.  A few
years before, the Classification Research Group had issued a
memorandum proclaiming 'the need for a faceted classification
as the basis of all methods of information retrieval.'  As part-author
of this memorandum, I must now judge the claim to have been
too bold, even brash.  But it has been vindicated to an extent,
for both in theory and practice the value of facet analysis, in
the organization of subject vocabularies for indexing and search,
has been widely accepted - whether these vocabularies are classified
or alphabetical, and whether used in pre- or post-coordinate fashion.

Classification Practice in Britain.  Report on a survey of classification

Davison, K.

  The objectives of the Sub-Committee in starting their enquiries were
basically three-fold
     1) To gather a reasonable collection of statistics relating to the general
        practice of classification in this country.
     2) To gather information on th actual use of the Dewey Decimal
        Classification in this country.
     3) To provide a basis for the recommendations which are provided
        periodically for the Dewey Editorial Policy Committee from the
        Library Association Library Research Committee's Sub-Committee on
        Dewey Decimal Classification Revision.
To this end a questionnaire was sent out to over 1100 libraries of all types
throughout the country and after six months reminders sent to librarians
to ensure they had received them and that none had been overlooked.  The
result of this was very pleasing; 716 were returned, the vast majority 
completed correctly.  The actual figures of type and size of library are
given in the body of the report but no type of library is completely omitted
and a significant proportion of the larger libraries returned the 
questionnaire.

Classification Scheme for Law Books
.A
Moys, E.M.
.W
  An examination made over a period of years of the principles of
classifying law books for use in libraries, and of their treatment in
many general and specialized classification schemes convinced me that
no scheme existed which was generally suitable for libraries in English-
speaking countries outside the United States.  Law collections in
academic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth were
in a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting one
of the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate
provision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of
adopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored
to a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited
to overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  There
seemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme
capable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, general
and special, academic and professional, in these countries.

Classification and Subject Index for a Library
.A
Dewey, M.
.W
  The plan of the following Classification and Index was developed early in
1873.  It was the result of several months' study of library economy as found
in some hundreds of books and pamphlets, and in over fifty personal visits to
various American libraries.  In this study, the author became convinced that
the usefulness of these libraries might be greatly increased without additional
expenditure.  Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads him
to believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the 
catalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross-references essential to this
increased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other method
which he has been able to find.  The system was devised for cataloguing and
indexing purposes, but it was found on trial to be equally valuable for
numbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves.

Classification Catalogue Code
.A
Ranganathan, S.R.
.W
  The Author, the Dictionary and the Classified catalogues
represent three successive stages in the order of evolution
of the internal form of the Library Catalogue.  The classified
form being the latest to evolve, the literature relating
to it is comparatively scanty.  It is strikingly so in the
form of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing.  While
the number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairly
large and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is also
respectable, there appear to be few systematic and complete
codes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue.
Hence this little venture, which is based on twenty-five
years of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal
influence gained by its being taught to students of library
science during the last twenty years.
  While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples given
are constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules of
this Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for
their applicability.  They are all of general application,
irrespective of the scheme of classification in use.

Cleaning and Processing Bindings and Related Materials
.A
Horton, C.
.W
  The destructive effects of air pollution in the modern city upon
the health of its people, its trees, and its gardens, even its buildings
and statues, are well known and are being increasingly fought
against.  But the public, generally, and even many librarians
and book-collectors, who should know better, are apparently unaware
of the rapid deterioration of the world's libraries under these
conditions.  In libraries, museums, and private homes preventive care
is regularly given to pictures and sculpture, fine furniture, silver
and brass; but the gradually deteriorating volumes on the shelves are
given no more attention than an occasional dusting which abrades
the books more than it protects them.  I would judge that more than
90 percent of the books and documents that come to my bindery
for repair or restoration are in a condition that could have been
avoided by regular and appropriate preventive care.  Unfortunately,
even when the custodians of books become aware of the problem,
they my be handicapped by the relative unavailability of expert
advice on what procedures to follow in conserving their libraries.
The present essay is intended to meet this need.

Code of Cataloging Rules

    The following rules represent a system designed to
produce an instrument essential to the operations and services

apply them properly, it is necessary to comprehend the 
objectives which the catalog is to serve, the method by which
these objectives are to be achieved, the basic aspects of the
problem of cataloging, and the general principles which underlie
the rules.
     Objectives.  The objectives which the catalog is to serve
are two:
     First, to facilitate the location of a particular 
publication, i.e. of a particular edition of a work, which
is in the library.
     Second, to relate and display together the editions which
a library has of a given work and the works which it has of a
given author.

Quantitative Criteria for Adequacy of Academic Library Collection

   The authors challenge accepted doctrine which asserts that the adequacy of 
an academic library cannot be measured by the number of books which it 
contains.. Out of their feeling that the Standards for College Libraries and 
the Standards for Junior College Libraries are inadequate for estimating the 
size (in volumes) required for minimum adequacy by libraries of institutions of
higher education of widely differing characteristics, they developed new 
formulas for this purpose.. These formulas attempt to identify the principal
factors affecting academic needs for books and to ascribe suitable to each
factor.. The authors then illustrate the application of the formulas to 
specific institutions, and conclude that while the results are useful, further 
research in needed.. They end by suggesting specific topics for such research..

System Analysis in University Libraries

   A comprehensive enginnering approach to the analysis and functional design 
of library systems is described in terms of fundamental space-time relationship 
which characterize university libraries.. Long-run trends in aquisitions and
circulation are related to the relative obsolescence of stored materials, and 
the uncertainty of short-run demand pattern is related to the need for excess
service capability.. The spatial dispertion of library resources among 
specialized information centers and central depositories is considered with
respect to availability, retrieval, duplication, and efficient storage..

Subject Specialists in a University Library
.A
Byrd, Cecyl K.
.W
   In an attempt to supply in other disciplines the bibliographical expertise
traditionally furnished by university library systems to departments with 
departmental libraries, Indiana University has over the past three years
established ten subject specialist positions in the social sciences, 
humanities, and area studies programs.. These librarians select materials, 
render reference service to faculty members and graduate students, give 
instruction in library use, and serve generally as the main channel of 
communication between the library and the academic departments to which they 
are allied..

Sampling and Short-Period Usage in the Purdue Library
.A
Jain, A. K.
.W
   Several possible methods of sampling of social science monograph titles in 
the general library of Purdue University were considered, and a "good" method
was used to obtain estimates of their usage in the library and at home during 
the period July 1 - August 4, 1964.. The term relative usage was defined and 
used to study the effect of: (1) language, (2) country of publication, (3) 
year of publication, and (4) year of accession of a monograph title.. An 
attempt was made to fit a regression model for titles in English by quantifying
the last three independent variables with relative usage as the dependent 
variable.. Functions based on the above variables have been developed to 
identify monograph titles for storage..
   A questionnaire was employed to stady the usage of library facilities and to 
gather opinions of library patrons.. Purpose of visiting the library, reason 
for checkout of library material, reason for preferring library or home for the 
use of library material, etc., were analyzed on the basis of the replies 
received..

Conflict in Libraries
.A
Bundy, Mary Lee
.W
   Intergroup conflict in libraries is explored, including conflict between
departments, between professionals and bureaucracy, and between older and newer
staff members.. Other special interests such as informal power-holders and the
subprofessional are identified.. This analysis shows that existing 
organizational relationships in libraries let "means" become "ends".. Strong
forces toward conformity hamper desirable growth and change.. A restructuring
of libraries is proposed along the lines of professional rather than 
semiprofessional organizations.. Principal changes to be made are in existing
processing-service relationships and administrative-professional 
relationships..

Determining and Allocating Book Funds for Current Domestic Buying
.A
McGrath, William E.
.W
   A device is outlined to help formulate the annual book budget request..
Courses described in the college catalog are matched with the books listed in 
the American Book Publishing Record, BPR, Cumulative 1965.. Courses, treated
as if monographes, are designed Dewey classification numbers and arranged in 
decimal sequence by groups.. Books in BPR falling into the groups are tallied;
the DC groups are then rearranged by departments and the number and cost of 
books in each are totaled.. Results are sound estimates of each department's
probable current domestic book needs for that year and may be applied to the 
subsequent year as an estimate of what will probably be needed.. They may be 
used as factors in an allocation formula..

Professionalism Reconsidered
.A
Bundy, Mary Lee
.A
Wasserman, Paul
.W
   The question of librarianship as a profession is considered here in terms of 
the three key relationships of a professional-client, organizational and 
professional.. Professional practice in this field is thus cast against 
accepted norms and standards of professional behavior.. This critical 
assessment suggests that librarianship falls far short of the professional 
model.. Major shifts in the nature of the services performed by librarians
and in their bureaucratic relationships will be required if librarianship is to
advance.. The contributions of the professional associations and of library
schools to the advancement of the process of professionalization is also 
analyzed.. Progress in the field is viewed to be inextricably tied to the 
success or failure which librarianship achieves in its quest for true 
professional attainment..

The Bottomless Pit, or the Academic Library as Viewed from the 
 Administration Building

Munn, Robert F.
.W
   Library administrators could adjudge their likely fortunes in the academic 
tug-of war for funds if they understood more clearly the attitudes of 
institutional administrators toward libraries.. Some view the library as "a
bottomless pit"; all recognize that the library is unlikely to generate much
political pressure for its own aggrandizement.. Many young institutional
administrators are coming to apply more sophisticated measures to their funding 
formulas than have been utilized in the past..Librarians therefore would be 
well advised to become more proficient in modern management techniques and 
program budgeting concepts..

Question-Negotiation and Information Seeking in Libraries
.A
Taylor, Robert S.
.W
   Seekers of information in libraries either go through a librarian 
intermediary or they help themselves.. When they go through librarians they 
must develop their questions through four levels of need, referred to here as 
the visceral, conscious, formalized, and compromised needs.. In this pre-search
interview with an information-seeker the reference librarian attempts to help
him arrive at an understanding od his "compromised" need by determining: (1) 
the subject of his interest; (2) his motivation; (3) his personal 
characteristics; (4) the relationship of the inquiry to file organization; 
and (5) anticipated answers.. The author contends that research is needed into
the techniques of conducting this negotiation between the user and the 
reference librarian..

Measuring Classified Circulation According to Curriculum
.A
McGrath, Wiiliam E.
.W
   Circulation statistics can be precise reflections of library use according 
to the curriculum.. The statistics can help the librarian decide how to 
allocate the budget to departments.. Traditional counts, by department 
personnel or by broad Dewey or LC classes, are imprecise.. An analogy between
curriculum and circulation can be constructed by classifying courses in the
college catalog (by DC or LC), rearranging the numbers thus generated by 
department, and then counting circulation within those groups.. The analogy is
thus a quantitative measure and a precise reflection of library use according
to curriculum..

The Title Catalog: A Third Dimension

   The accessibility of the card catalog seems to be inversely proportional to
the complexity of its arrangement.. A catalog divided into author-title and
subject sequence simplifies the filing order of cards and facilitates the use 
of each catalog.. It is argued here that a three-way division into author, 
title, and subject catalogs will further augment these advantages.. In this 
paper a separation of the title catalog at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
library is described and evaluated..

An Allocation Formula Derived from a Factor Analysis of Academic Department

McGrath, William E.

Huntsinger, Ralph C.

Barber, Gary R.
.W
   The authors derive a book fund distribution formula from a factor analysis 
of twenty-two variables which measure and quantify academic departments.. The
analysis generates a 22 x 22 matrix of correlations.. A few of the significant
correlations are discussed; e.g. those between books published and books 
circulated (high correlation) and circulation-by-subject and 
circulation-by-person (low correlation).. The factor analysis sorts out the 
complex relationships between the twenty-two variables and reduces them to 
three main factors - two of which seem to describe materials used and users.. 
The third may describe needs.. The three factors are the chief elements in the 
formula.. Each factor can be represented by any one or more of the variables 
in that factor..

   Questions about the accuracy of library records, the behavior or attitudes
of patrons, or the conditions of the books in the collection can often be 
answered by a random sampling study.. Use of this time and money saving 
technique requires no special mathematical ability or statistical background..
The concept of accuracy is discussed and a table is provided to simplify the
determination of an appropriate sample size.. A method of selecting a sample 
using random numbers is shown.. Three examples illustrate the application of 
the technique to library problems..

Program Budgeting and Cost Benefit Analysis in Library
.A
Keller, John E.
.W
   Libraries in academic institutions have traditionally prepared annual
budgets based either upon subjective judgments or upon oversimplified 
formulas.. Two budgeting techniques recently introduced into universities from 
the defense establishment are program budgeting and benefit analysis.. Properly
applied they can be utilized to gain better decisions in problems facing 
academic library managers and improved allocation of library resources..

User Circulation Satisfaction vs. Size of Holdings at Three Academic 
Libraries
.A
Trueswell, Richard W.
.W
   In an effort to determine certain facts concerning the relation of 
circulation satisfaction to collection size, the author sampled the "last 
circulation date" of stack books and of circulated books in three considerably 
different kinds of academic libraries.. The experience of these three libraries 
proved to be surprisingly similar.. The author speculates concerning potential 
uses to which such data might be profitably applied..

The Economic Goal of Library Automation
.A
Kilgour, Frederick, G.
.W
   A steadily increasing rate of productivity should be the economic goal of 
library automation.. Such productivity will be achieved only by development of
a new library technology.. Thereby, rise in library costs, which are going up
exponentially at a frightening rate, will be brought into line with cost rises 
in the economy as a whole..

Classifying Courses in the University Catalog
.A
McGrath, William E.
.A
Durand, Norma
.W
   The authors contrast the university catalog and the card catalog and conclude
that the university catalog is the best guide to the university's current 
scholarly interest.. They urge that librarians study and classify courses 
therein, such as books, using the Library of Congress or Dewey Decimal schemes
so that specific class number are grouped by academic department and become
substantial spans.. The profile can be used as a selection tool, as a 
correlating tool between curriculum, circulation and publishing, and as a 
device to aid weeding and shelving.. General and specific quidelines for 
classifying, including a method for resolving apparent duplication of courses 
in different departments are presented.. Time and unit figures are tabulated..
Specific steps in classification and editing are described..

Modernizing the University Library Structure
.A
Kaser, D.
.W
  Among the several kinds of change that appear to be in order in personnel
management in university libraries, some have been described, others have
not.  There has perhaps been a super-abundance of attention devoted, for
example, to the inadequate treatment of librarians within the university 
community as a whole, but little discussion has thus far appeared in print 
concerning their treatment within the library itself. This paper will attempt 
to define certain progressive changes that it is possible and probably 
desirable for the library to implement internally regardless of the university's
willingness to consider improving the librarian's lot in the larger community.

User's Reaction to Microfiche A Preliminary Study
.A
Lewis, Ralph W.
.W
   Recent emphasis placed on the use of microfiche  by large government agencies
has increased the pressure in libraries supporting government research to make
greater use of microfiche.. Negative and apathetic user attitudes, expressed by
researchers, indicate that expanded efforts to overcome resistance if the great 
potential of microfiche is to be realized.. Efforts in microphotography, 
expended on technical achievement in the past, should be directed toward
understanding the user and his needs to discover why he avoids microforms and
how to overcome his resistance to them..

Correlation the Subjects of Books Taken Out Of and Books Used Within an 
Open-Stack Library
.A
McGrath, William E.
.W
   The traditional over-the-counter circulation count is not always considered 
a reliable indicator of total library use.. To test this assumption the author
hypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken out
of the library and those used within the library.. Counts were made of books 
left on tables, chairs, desks, and other surfaces and correlated to books 
charged out.. Two studies were made.. In the first, books were counted within 
finely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments..
In the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second letters 
and the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in the
second, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-library 
circulation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use.. For predicting
in-library use (and thus total use) two methods are cited-simple ratio of out 
to in, and the regression equation..

A Generalized Methodology for Library Systems Analysis
.A
Burns, R.W.
.W
  This article is directed toward the service in systems work.  Its purpose is 
to generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can be
used in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a point
of view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-making
and resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticated
techniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however,
will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made to
discuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming,
simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any of
the other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations 
research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearly
understood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenal
of the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, a
delineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in 
this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard 
techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations 
researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian.

Cost Accounting and Analysis for University Libraries
.A
Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F.
Cooper, Michael D.
.W
   The approach to library planning studies in this paper is the use of 
accounting models to measure library costs and implement program budgets.. A 
cost-flow model for a university library is developed and tested with 
historical data from the General Library at the University of California,
Berkeley.. Various comparisons of an exploratory nature are made of the unit 
costs and total costs for different parts of the Berkeley system..

Change in Academic Libraries
.A
Haro, Robert P.
.W
Never noted for their willingness to accept innovative suggestions and 
implement change from outside sources, academic libraries have remained 
institutions in which changes in service policies and programs originated from 
internal sources only.. In order to shift to an orientation that seeks to 
develop new and expanding service programs, the establishment to research 
groups could do much to improve both the services offered by a library and its
role in the academic community.. While certain constraints always limit 
modification or the initiation of services, a properly constituted research 
group could do much to generate a climate for change, provide feedback to the 
library, and successfully continue to develop new and more effective library 
and information services..

Key Factors of Circulation System Analysis and Design
.A
McGee, Rob
.W
   Librarians must frequently judge circulation systems on the basis of widely 
disparate descriptions that make comparisons difficult.. A way is needed to 
place  various systems into a common perspective framework, so that their 
similarities and differences can be readily understood.. This paper explains 
basic (and largely familiar) concepts and components that are common to manual,
machine-aided, and computer-based systems, and documents their significance as 
key factors in the analysis and design of academic library circulation systems..
Cost factors are not discussed..

   A description of the methodology used in collecting performance data in a
large academic research library is given.. Twelve types of surveys used to 
measure and evaluate users, services, and materials were developed and 
conducted during the period 1968/69 at Columbia University libraries and later
evaluated.. Sample results are included.. Costs of providing research services
were found to be 64 percent versus 36 percent for instructional services..

Participative Management in Relation to Library Effectiveness
.A
Lynch, Beverly
.W
   This paper reviews a recent study on the influence of participative 
management on library performance.. Because most of the recent theoretical and 
empirical research being done in this area is ignored and an invalid measure of
participation in decision making is used, the study provides no basis for the
generalization that in increase in the library staff's participation in 
decision making will increase the library's effectiveness..

The Changing Role of Directors of University Libraries
.A
McAnally, Arthur M.
Downs, Robert B.
.W
   The role of the university library director has changed markedly in the last 
decade.. The position of library director has become a difficult role to serve..
Directors has been subjected to pressures from different quarters.. Five sources
are identified by the authors, including pressures from the president's office,
library stuff, faculty, and students.. These difficulties coupled with a 
declining ability to meet user needs, the lack of cohesive library planning, 
and an institutional inability to accommodate change have all contributed to the
declining status of the library director.. Recommendations as to ways to 
ameliorate the problem are offered.. Among the suggestions included are better
planning, improved budgeting techniques, and the introduction of new 
organizational patterns..

MacDonald, Robin W.
Elrod, J. Mcree

   A method of developing computer catalogs is proposed which does not require
unit card conversion but rather the accumulation of data from operating 
programs..  It is proposed that the bibliographic and finding functions of the
catalog be separated, with the latter being the first automated.. Such 
automation is seen as being advantageous on a cost basis..

Faculty Awareness and Attitudes Toward Academic Library Reference Services:
A Measure of Communication
.A
Nelson, Jerold
.W
   A survey of the faculties at six colleges was undertaken to measure the 
degree to which the libraries of those institutions were communicating with the
faculty concerning the availability of various references services.. The results
demonstrated that the average faculty member was aware of barely half the 
services actually available.. Variables of academic rank, length of teaching, 
and amount of library and reference use were some of the factors shown to 
affect faculty awareness of library service..

.A
Flener, Jane G.
.W
   A CLR Fellowship in 1971-72 enabled the author to examine staff participation
in the management of large academic libraries.. The report considers the climate
of participation, preparation given the staff, areas of decision making, the 
role of the professional staff association, and the reaction of staff to such 
participation..

Applying "Management by Objectives" To the University Library
.A
Johnson, Edward R.
.W
   Many methods of library management are no longer sufficient to meet the more
sophisticated demands of today.. A promising management technique for 
librarians is "managements by objectives", which helps to establish library 
goals, measure performance objectively, and to identify factors affecting an
operation's final results..

Reference-Bibliographers in the College Library
.A
Gration, Selby U.
Young, Arthur P.
.W
   One approach to making college library more relevant, dynamic, and 
intelligible is to employ specialists with broad subject competence, throughly
familiar with the terminology, bibliographic tools, and major writings of 
several related disciplines.. These subject specialists or reference-
bibliographers provide reference and institutional services, and serve as 
coordinators between academic departments and the library.. A significant 
increase in the quality of library service is attained with reference-
bibliographers both building and interpreting the collection.. The reference-
bibliographer concept is examined from several perspectives: historical
antecedents; relationship to the academic setting; and the authors' experience
with a staff of subject specialists at a predominantly undergraduate college
library during 1969-1972..

   The Management Review and Analysis Program (MRAP), designed, tested, and 
operated by the Association of Research Libraries' Office of University Library
Management Studies (OMS), is an assisted self-study strategy intended for use 
by large academic and research libraries.. The program assists libraries in 
reviewing and analyzing their current management policies and practices, and
provides guidelines for the application of contemporary principles of 
management for the improvement of library programs..

Allocating the Book Budget: A Model
.A
Kohut, Joseph J.
.W
   Inflation is currently affected library book budgets, particularly with 
respect to the acquisition of serials.. A model is proposed which would balance
the purchase of serials against the purchase of monographs by individual 
funding units within the academic library.. Special consideration is given to 
inflation as a cost factor affected by both the form of publication and the 
subject matter.. Applying the model to a specific example demonstrates its use 
in providing control over collection development and allowing for equitable 
distribution of book funds among funding units..

analysis.. A list of normative issues is derived from raising descriptive
questions about the politics of university libraries..

Providing Access to Externally Available Bibliographic Data Bases 
 in an Academic Library
.A
Hock, Randilph E.
.W
   The ready availability of externally processed bibliographic data based has 
made it possible for an academic library to provide computerized searches on a
large number of data bases with a very small initial investment and utilizing 
its own personnel.. The experience of the University of Pennsylvania Libraries 
has confirmed that such an approach is indeed feasible. This article discusses 
the approach, questions and problems encountered, and the factors considered in
their resolution.. Also discussed are the role of the data services librarian, 
the cost incurred, and some observations as to the philosophy of the approach, 
with particular attention to the integration of the service into the reference 
department..

The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology
.A
Gouldner, A.W.
.W
  The criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only
at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about
society.  Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the
history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing
wider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the
New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least
temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.
  This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In some
part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new
and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited
energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time
to produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory is
scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact
that American radicals are often more American than they know and
may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the
intangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical
problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals
have with the "hippie" contingent of their generation, whose more
expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture
dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile "hassles" of
intellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, as
has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to
reason.

The SMART Automatic Document Retrieval System - An Illustration
.A
Salton, Gerard
Lesk, M.E.
.W
   A fully automatic document retrieval system operating on the IBM 7094 is 
described.. The system is characterized by the fact that several hundred
different  methods are available to analyze  documents and search requests..
This feature is used in the retrieval process by leaving the exact sequence of
operations initially unspecified, and adapting the search strategy to the needs
of individual users..
   The system is used not only to simulate an actual operating environment, but
also to test the effectiveness of the various available processing methods..
Results obtained so far seem to indicate that some combination of analysis 
procedures can in general be relied upon to retrieve the wanted information..
A typical search request is used as an example in the present  report to
illustrate systems operations  and evaluation procedures..

A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Banks
.A
Cod, E.F.
.W
  Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how 
the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting
service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution.. 
Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain 
unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed
and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed.. Changes
in data representation will often be nedded as a result of changes in query, 
update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored 
information.. 
  Existing noninferential, formated data systems provide users with tree-
structured files or slightly more general network models of the data.. In 
Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.. A model based on n-ary
relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal
data sublanguage are introduced.. IN Section 2, certain operations (other than 
logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and
consistency in the user's model..

Communication among Scientists and Engineers
.A
Lin, N.
Garvey, W.D.
Nelson, C.E.
.W
  Since 1966, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Research in Scientific
Communication has been conducting studies of the information flow process -
the production, dissemination, and assimilation of information - associated with
nine scientific and engineering disciplines.  This process in most disciplines
appears, from the dissemination point of view, to consume about five years -
from the time a scientist begins his research until reports of his findings are
cited in a review.  To date we have conducted over sixty studies of this process
and, since one of the main goals of our program is to make genuine comparisons
of the scientific communication associated with the disciplines being studied,
we have standardized the procedures, instruments, and analyses in those of the
major studies which were conducted for all disciplines.
  We will present findings from the major studies conducted to date in order
(1) to indicate the types of data we have collected on approximately 30,000
scientists and engineers during the past three years; (2) to indicate some of
the goals of our program; and (3) to suggest a preliminary picture of the
communication structure of science, as our program has led us to perceive it.

Communication of Innovations:  A Cross-Cultural Approach
.A
Rogers, E.M.
Shoemaker, F.F.
.W
  In the present edition we have, to a far greater extent, integrated diffusion
research with the scientific study of human communication.  Diffusion
researchers have long been aware that they were investigating a special type
of communication behavior.  In this book we stress communication concepts
and frameworks in our analysis of the diffusion process.  We feel this provides
an advantage of conceptual clarity as well as ease of wide expression.  Our
adoption of the communication viewpoint is reflected in the addition of
several chapters, the complete reorganization of all chapters, and the frequent
inclusion of new concepts.

Communication among Scientists and Engineers
.A
Nelson, C. E.
.W
   In the course of collecting data on nine scientific and technological
disciplines, it has become obvious to us that in their communication 
activities, some disciplines behave quite differently from others.. Recently,
we have reanalyzed our data for the physical, the engineering, and the social
sciences.. We do not have time to discuss differences among all three groups,
so we have decided to compare only the physical and social sciences.. We have
included data pertaining to the engineering sciences on the graphs, however,
so you can get some idea of how they differ from the other two groups..
   Before discussing these differences, we should like to emphasize that there
are similarities, that there are of major importance, and that they, in fact,
make genuine comparisons among the groups feasible..
   We will discuss differences between the physical and the social sciences in
terms of three major communication characteristics associated with science..

Citation Measures of Hard Science, Soft Science, Technology and Nonscience
.A
de Solla Price, D.
.W
  Perhaps the fundamental problem of those that work in the scientific
information industry is that it is not just that special part of an information
industry that happens to deal with material having a scientific content.  
Technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to 
books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics.
  My reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategic
conference is that I know well as an historian of science that the greatest and
most useful advances in our technologies have not come from the applied
research of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society, but
rather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity,
and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised.
I suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be more
useful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will to
solving practical problems for which they are designed.  It seems clear,
however, that it is only such new understanding that can bring success,
whatever solutions ultimately emerge.

Natural Language Question - Answering System: 1969
.A
Simmons, Robert F.
.W
   Recent experiments in programming natural language question-answering system
are reviewed to summarize the methods that have been developed for syntactic, 
semantic, and logical analysis of English strings.. It is concluded that at
least minimally effective  techniques have been devised for answering questions
from natural language subsets in small scale experimental systems and that a 
useful paradigm has evolved to guide research efforts in the field.. Current 
approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective 
beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects
of meaning or to applications over large subset of English.. Generalizing from
current small-scale experiments to language processing systems based on 
dictionaries with thousands of entries - with correspondingly large grammars 
and semantic systems - may entail a new order of complexity and require the 
invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis 
and question answering..

Inefficiency of the Use of Boolean Functions for Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Verhoeff, J.
Goffman, W.
Belzer, J.
.W
  In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions
are, in general, not applicable in information retrieval
systems.
  First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedly
is to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize some
overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of
it.  This situation is, of course, well known. 
  Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance
implies that the reward varies with different circumstances.
That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree
that the system's output is satisfactory.  However, these
should be relatively few.  In the case of an information
retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to
furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question.  
So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions
Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q)
which is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot be
chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between
the question and the resulting reference list.  Usually
one says that the documents in the list are relevant to
the question.  More precisely stated, we assume that the
enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one
he would have procured had he himself probed the documents
in the set.

The Teachable Language Comprehender:
A Simulation Program and Theory of Language
.A
Quillian, M.R.
.W
  The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program
designed to be capable of being taught to "comprehend"
English text.  When text which the program has not seen before
is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating
each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large
memory.  This memory is a "semantic network" representing
factual assertions about the world.
  The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory
which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting
and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the
new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program
successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as
that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the
memory.
  Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities
for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to
be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently
contains a relatively small number of examples of such
assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for
expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program
now corresponds to a general process for comprehending
language, and it provides a methodology for adding the
additional information this process requires to actually
comprehend text of any particular kind.
  The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC
allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating
text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating
text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically.
That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the
system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many
other sentences in the future.

An Information-Theoretic Approach to Text Searching
in Direct Access Systems
.A
Barton, I.J.
Creasey, S.E.
Lynch, M.F.
Snell, M.J.
.W
  Using direct access computer files of bibliographic
information, an attempt is made to overcome one of the
problems often associated with information retrieval,
namely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries,
the greater part of which is used only infrequently.
A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic
frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a
rectangular distribution.  This is more suited to 
implementation on storage devices.
  This method treats text as a string of characters
rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  The members of this
subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  The
rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much
simplified file organization and promises considerable
cost advantages.

The Community College Library
.A
Veit, F.
.W
  This study deals with the learning resources programs of the public
two-year colleges.  In former years, these institutions were commonly
called junior colleges, and the college departments or divisions that
assembled, organized, and interpreted the learning resources (mainly
books) were commonly called libraries.  In keeping with traditional
terminology I could have chosen "The Junior College Library" as the
title for the study; however, I decided to modify the title to make it
correspond more closely to prevailing current terminology.

Comparative and International Librarianship; essays on themes and problems
.A
Jackson, M.M.
.W
  In this decade, professionals in the field of librarianship and the
information sciences will continue to be faced with most of the
problems that have haunted libraries for generations, problems that
can be best summed up as the attempt to reduce the anonymity of
information.  There will also be many new problems.  Some of these
are already becoming apparent, while others are still unknown.  But
librarians need not despair; the past record is clear.  Through the use
of sophisticated electronic machines, we have begun to master the
bibliographical control and retrieval of information, we have
improved the communication between librarians and the consumers
of information on a national and international basis, and we have
refined the many problems concerned with cataloging and classifying
information.  In addition, library education has been on the front
line in trying to educate people to understand the complexities of
organizing and disseminating information of all types.

Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English
.A
Kucera, H.
.W
  Readers can expect to find many parts of this volume tantalizing.  The 
definiteness of the answers to certain questions irresistibly provokes more 
questions.  The happy feature is that the book provides information required 
to limit the effect to that of tantalizing rather than frustrating. For there 
is given here a wholly adequate description of the nature of the Corpus of
Present-Day Edited American English on which this study is based, the details 
of its constituents, and the modes of its transfer to tape.  A replica of that 
tape is available at a small cost in money, which is minuscule compared to the 
cost in time needed to produce a like corpus.  Accordingly, any reader who 
seriously wants answers to further questions can set about getting those 
answers.

Computer-Based Library and Information Systems
.A
Henley, J.P.
.W
  This book describes some of the various ways in which a computer
could be used as part of a library system.  In doing so, it aims to bridge
the gap between librarian and computer specialist, by introducing
computers to those involved in library work, especially students of
librarianship, and at the same time helping to make those interested
in the computer applications field aware of the potential and problems
of the library environment.

Computer Filing of Index Bibliographic and Catalog Entries
.A
Hines, T.C.
.W
  The need to establish a filing code for computer arrangement
has become increasingly apparent as more and more book
catalogs and indexes have been prepared mechanically.  Many
of the difficulties in manual filing, as shown in the A.L.A. Rules
for Filing Catalog Cards, become even more intricate to cope
with when computers are used.  Of course, if cost is not an
object, the theoretical potentialities for computer programming are
practically limitless.  However, modifications in rules and procedures
can make the alphabetic arranging or merging of index, catalog,
or bibliographic entries by computer more readily possible, and
these modifications are made in this proposed code for computer
filing of complex alphabetic entries.

Computer Handling of Chemical Structure Information
.A
Lynch, M.F.
.W
  Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in science
are at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamental
effects on scientists's use of and access to existing knowledge.
These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer
techniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific
and technical information.  Many of the implications of the changes
are not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from a
labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring
man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and
increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access.
But the changes to be effected also have major social implications;
the reasons for publication and use of information are complex,
reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still 
imperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information-
handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their
appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer,
but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators
of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their
perception of the usefulness of the newer methods.

Current approaches to classification and clump-finding at the Cambridge
Language Research Unit
.A
Sparck-Jones, K.
Jackson, David
.W
   Computer programs for automatic classification are a desideratum in many 
fields.. Work on suitable procedures for handling large bodies of object/
property descriptions has been in progress at the Cambridge Language Research
Unit for some years: this paper describes the current series of general-purpose
programs which have been developed there, in which classes or "clamps" of
objects are obtained, using a similarity matrix, by a simple iterative scan of 
the universe of objects, distributing them in such a way that an appropriate 
cohesion function is minimized.. This actual clump-finding process is embedded
in a overall package in which the information given by a classification is 
manipulated in a variety of ways.. The current applications of the programs, 
especially for information retrieval, are described..

The identification of variable-length, equifrequent character strings in a
natural language data base
.A
Clare, A.C.
Cook, Elizabeth M.
Lynch, M.F.
.W
   The words of natural language texts exhibit a Poisson (or Zipfian) rank-
frequency relationship, i.e., a small number of common words accounts for a 
large proportion of word occurrences, while a large number of the words occur 
as singletons or only infrequently.. Inverted-file retrieval systems using free
text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which 
the file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore 
involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization
of storage because of the distribution characteristics..
   An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of
sets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of
which are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to 
substantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in 
dictionary look-up times and storage utilization.

.A
Williams, M.E.
.W
  This document, Computer Readable Bibliographic Data Bases -- A Directory
and Data Sourcebook not only updates the 1973 publication, which included 
information on 81 data bases, but expands the coverage to 300 data bases and 
includes considerably more information about the data bases.
  Methodology used to obtain data involved:  (1) consulting published and
unpublished sources; (2) design of a 13 page questionnaire; (3) mail survey;
and (4) telephone follow up and verification.  The sources consulted were
(1) the Survey of Commercially Available Computer-Readable Bibliographic
Data Bases; (2) M.E. Williams' personal data base files which include
information from the open literature, news releases, and personal contacts;
(3) NEWSIDIC, April 1975 issue number 16, the quarterly newsletter produced
by EUSIDIC which included a survey of computer readable bibliographic files;
(4) the "World Inventory of Abstracting and Indexing Services--Data Elements
Definition List;" and (5) the ASIDIC Survey of Information Center Services.

Computerized Library Catalogs: Their Growth, Cost and Utility
.A
Dolby, J.L.
.W
  This book is a slightly modified form of a report on computerized
library catalogs prepared for the Office of Education of the United States
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (Contract OEC-1-7-
071182-5013).  It consists of seven chapters.  The first poses the problems
that have been studied, introduces background material to facilitate an
understanding of their significance, and presents our conclusions and
general recommendations.  The remaining chapters belong to one of two
parts, depending on whether their principle concern is the utility or the
cost of computeerized library catalogs.  Because the problem of utility is the
more speculative of the two, it has been placed in the second part.

The Concept of Main Entry as Represented in the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules
.A
Hamdy, M.N.
.W
  The work published here is rather like those conclusive statements
of renaissance science that located the soul not in the human frame but
in the human spirit.  The author of this work may face the wrath of the
medievalists among our fellow professional catalogers.  At the least, the
publication of this book should encourage a complete reappraisal of our
cataloging methods, because the difference between title unit entry and
author-equivalent unit entry, a confabulation of main and unit entry
arising from tradition rather than practicality, can be clearly seen not 
only in the job classifications and job descriptions of cataloging
departments, but also in our philosophy of librarianship.

Concepts and Subject Headings

Christ, J.M.
.W
        Librarians are known for their organizational work
with recorded knowledge.  Information storage and retrieval
are two well-known, basic functions associated with this
work.  A search of the literature of library science reveals
that these functions have not been examined to any significant
degree from the users' point of view.  This is true in regard
to library catalogs and library subject headings.

Conceptual Basis of the Classification of Knowledge
.A
Wojciechowski, J.A.
.W
  As far as philosophers are concerned, the Conference seems to be justified
precisely because of the present state of the Classification of Knowledge.  For
two thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a major
philosophical problem.  Lately, it has evolved from a philosophical
preoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques 
of classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally
ignored by philosophers.  At the present time there exist powerful technical
models of classification and highly developed classifications of various
branches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory general
classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical
problems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification is
important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because
the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of
knowledge.  It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists
in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest.

Conceptual Design of an Automated National Library System
.A
Meise, N.R.
.W
    This work describes a conceptual design of an automated
national library system.  The design is "conceptual" in that it is
intended to show the feasibility of a system concept rather than
provide a detailed engineering design.  The design concerns an
automated national library system but does not attempt to automate
all parts of the system.  It is primarily concerned with the functions of
bibliographic searching, acquisition, circulation, and cataloging.  If
these functions can be economically automated, the major problems
associated with our information explosion will be solved.

Continuing Library and Information Science Education
.A
Stone, E.W.
.W
  This report and its recommendations are in response to the Commission's
request for "a nationwide program of continuing education for personnel in
the library and information science field."  While it is offered as only the
start of an on-going process of developing a nationwide program, its
recommendations are the result of an intensive nine-month project, involving
hundreds of persons in the library and information science fields.
  Many of these persons participated in mini-charettes, in a written survey,
or in personal interviews which addressed major issues such as: certification;
organizational and individual incentives for continuing education; educational
methods; and continuing education needs.  The contribution of these library
personnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective
have led the Project team to many of its major recommendations.  However,
as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved,
there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of
opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from
the various professions.  In the present study, most of these differences
related to the input into and control over the policies of the national
structure.  Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined
in Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended
model are presented at the end of Chapter 4.  Throughout the text, when issues
are presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity of
opinions expressed, these areas are identified.

Cooperation Between Types of Libraries
.A
Stenstrom, R.H.
.W
  This bibliography uses the traditional typology of libraries as its
starting point - public, school, academic-research, and special libraries.
This classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear
distinction for the purposes of this work.
  Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library's
district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied
for library purposes.  Local public libraries, systems of public libraries,
and state library agencies are included in this category.
  School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of
schools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School libraries
at the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level are
included.
  Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions of
higher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which,
while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely known
for their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries,
university libraries, and technical school libraries are included as
academic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and 
Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries.
  Special libraries are those directed toward making information available
to people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined
information needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries of
nonprofit organizations are common examples.
  While distinctions between research and special libraries are not
always easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, no
serious problems are created.

Copying Methods Manual
.A
Hawken, N.R.
.W
  The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes, 
methods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing 
documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors:
  (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the 
acquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information
vital to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an 
international scale.
  (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has 
resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.
  The need for the coining of the new class word - reprography (an unfortunate
graft of a Latin fragment on a Greek root) - is in itself indicative of the 
great changes that have come about.  Processes and methods which formerly were 
discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processes
and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities
continue to appear.  This revolution in the document copying field has been 
powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for 
a share of the vast and lucrative office-records copying field.  The results, 
however, have led to highly important applications in the reproduction of 
research materials as well.

Corporate Headings:  Their use in library cataloguing and
national bibliographics:  A comparative and critical study 
.A
Verona, E.
.W
  This study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the
main problems related to corporate headings, the difficulties
raised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various
countries.
  In order to make the differences existing between the various
solutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of
them more evident, a great number of examples in a variety of
languages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies, 
printed lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examples
are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with
regard to various technical details, such as punctuation, 
capitalization, transliteration, etc.
  In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that
certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one
country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of
another country or another language.
  In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been 
complemented by references to professional literature on the subject
available to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressed
there.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing
practices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users'
approach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciated
that, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for
corporate headings present more problems than any other type of
heading.  Unfortunately, however, professional literature has as
yet paid insufficient attention to these problems.

A Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge
.A
Kuhn, T.J.
.W
  On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems,
Sir Karl's view of science and my own are very nearly identical.  We
are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge
is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of
scientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate  
data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us
turn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we draw
many of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that science
progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by
which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one;
and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older
theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment,
or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number
of classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, for
example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation
with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to
produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists
may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and
that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.

  Information, whose handling is the topic of this book, is
generated by change, and whatever is our unit of change is our unit of
information.  In a situation in which only three possible moves can
be made, only three fundamental units of information can be found,
no matter how complex a structure we may build upon them.  Our
topic is therefore a special sort of change, the change brought about
in acquiring or keeping or transmitting elements of knowledge.

CAS computer-Based Information Services
.A
Davenport, W.C.
.W
  This paper describes the key points that characterize
CAS' approach to large scale scientific-technical information
systems that must handle over 100,000 documents per year.
The first of these points is the "single analysis/multiple
use" concept.  Intellectual ability is a rare commodity 
and essential to an information service.  Therefore, it makes
sense to conserve that commodity and not use manpower to
perform repetitive jobs or to waste effort analyzing information.

A Regional Network - Ohio college Library Center
.A
Kilgour, F.G.
.W
  The Ohio College Library Center is developing
a computerized, user-oriented, library system
that will improve efficiency of library use and
operations; that will increase availability of
library resources within a region; and that will facilitate
evolution of new and easier accesses to information in
libraries.  The center does not conceive of its task as being
merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past.
  For the immediate future, the principal academic objective
of the center is to increase the availability of library
resources for use in educational and research programs in
colleges and universities throughout Ohio.  A more distant
objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the
programs of instruction and research in their institutions.
The passive service functions that libraries have developed
during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the
present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly
inadequate in the future.
  The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat
more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general
economy.  Therefore, the principal economic goal of the
Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise
of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will
approximate that of the economy as a whole.

Decision Analysis:  Introductory Lectures on Choices Under Uncertainty
.A
Raiffa, H.
.W
  These lectures do not present a descriptive theory of actual behavior.
Neither do they present a positive theory of behavior for a superintelligent,
fictitious being; nowhere in our analysis shall we refer to the behavior of an
"idealized, rational, and economic man," a man who always acts in a perfectly
consistent manner as if somehow there were embedded in his nature a coherent
set of evaluation patterns that cover any and all eventualities.  Rather, the
approach we take prescribes how an individual who is faced with a problem of
choice under uncertainty should go about choosing a course of action that is
consistent with his personal basic judgements and preferences.  He must
consciously police the consistency of his subjective inputs and calculate
their implications for action.  Such an approach is designed to help us reason
and act a bit more systematically - when we choose to do so!

The Design of Inquiring Systems
.A
Churchman, C.W.
.W
  "Design" is used throughout in its most generic sense,
to include planning, operations research, engineering design,
architectural design, programming, budgeting, and all the other
activities in which we consciously attempt to change ourselves and our
environment to improve the quality of our lives.  So the book could be
read as a philosophy of organization theory, or of architectural or
engineering design, or of operations research, or of planning.
  The word "inquiry" suggests that the audience includes persons
interested in the philosophy of science; this is true, so long as the
interest is a very broad one, concerned with the meaning of science with
respect to other social institutions, health, education, morality, and so
on.  Inquiry is by no means restricted to the disciplines of science.  I
could have called the book The Design of Systems, but this would not
adequately reflect my style, which is to proceed from the more specific
problem of inquiry to the "whole system."

Deterioration and Preservation of Library Materials
.A
Winger, H.W.
.W
  The deterioration of library materials, constant since libraries began, has
accelerated to alarming proportions in 1969.  Researchers have predicted that
all paper-based records of this century, as well as those of earlier years,face
imminent ruin.  Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, most
will not be usable in their present form in the next century.  The danger of
destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world
of knowledge and scholarship that they support. For not only paper is involved.
Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such as
film, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records.  And not
only research libraries are involved. The surprisingly rapid deterioration of
printed materials, even those that have been produced with some eye to 
permanence, creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well.

Developing Multi-Media Libraries
.A
Hicks, W.B.
.W
  This book presents the concept of the modern library as a comprehensive
resource center.  The philosophy and objectives of the center are clarified,
and desirable practices in the selection and acquisition of nonbook or
audiovisual materials - interchangeably defined as those materials that 
communicate primarily through aural and visual stimuli - are recommended,
along with information pertinent to facilitating these tasks.  Their 
organization in general in discussed, with emphasis on the necessity for
basic decisions and policies.  Cataloging and physical processing are treated
in particular, demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexible
enough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specific
clientele.  Realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbook
materials are demonstrated by treating each type separately.  Many easy-to-
follow cataloging examples are presented; and, consistent with established
library routine, practical information is provided on selection, acquisition,
physical processing, storage, and equipment.  Work-flow charts are included
to present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures.

The Development of Reference Services through Academic Traditions,
Public Library Practice and Special Librarianship
.A
Rothstein, S.
.W
  Modern American library history has received only sporadic attention as a
subject for investigation.  Though we have now accumulated an adequate supply
of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service 
studies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries,
no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of American
librarianship.  To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants from
the past, but we have yet to convert them into history.
  The lack has cost the profession dearly.  Even a casual survey of the
literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and
naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts.
  There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the 
development of American library services which could eventually be put
together to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship.
The present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end.  It
undertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuing
problems of American librarianship - the provision of reference services in
research libraries.

Dewey Decimal Classification
.A
Dewey, M.
.W
  The schedules of Edition 18, like those of 17, are based on the
principle of subject integrity.  Both the subject matter and the notation are
hierarchical, so that what is true of a given whole is true of all its parts.
The schedules are developed according to logical principles, so that the
classifier is guided to make correct decisions.  The terminology of the
classification scheme reflects the terminology used by the literature
being classified.
  For ease of use, this edition includes many more example notes, more detailed
and precise instructions, and freer use of layman's terminology than did its
immediate predecessor.
  Since this edition is intended for use as a shelf-arrangement system for
general libraries of all sizes, its fulness is based upon the number of titles
that large libraries may be expected to acquire in various fields.  Since
it is also intended for use in classified catalogs and bibliographies (for
which the Dewey Decimal Classification is increasingly in demand in many
countries), it contains an increased number of provisions for number building.

Diffusion of Abstract and Indexing Services for Government - Sponsored Research

Klempner, I.M.
.W
  During the last several decades, science and technology have
undergone a drastic transformation.  The enormity and depth of this
transformation can be measured in many ways.  It can be measured
in terms of the number of students enrolled in graduate and
undergraduate schools offering degrees in the physical and applied
sciences, in terms of the number of new devices, products and
innovations introduced into the military establishment and into the 
civilian sector of our economy, in terms of the number of scientists and
engineers employed by industry and public and private institutions,
in terms of the amounts of money expended annually on research
and development, in terms of the number of technical reports, books,
journals, papers, reprints, and conference proceedings stemming
from these expenditures, and in many other ways.

Diffusion of Innovations
.A
Rogers, E.
.W
  This book is directed both to advanced college students
enrolled in sociology courses and to students of the other
social sciences (such as anthropology, economics, history,
and psychology) who are concerned with diffusion.  (For this 
reason, sociological concepts are defined when they are
introduced.)
  More than five hundred publications on the diffusion of
innovations are reviewed here.  The innovations studied range
from new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitive
tribes, and from driver training among public high 
schools to hybrid corn among farmers.  Although a generally
consistent set of findings has emerged from these studies, a
search of the literature shows little attempt to summarize and
evaluate available results and theories on the spread of ideas.
This volume synthesizes these findings and theories.

Directory of Data Base in the Social and Behavioral Sciences
.A
Sessions, V.S.
.W
  As one of the early members of the computer community, I have
been keenly interested in the development of quantitative methodologies
in the social and behavioral sciences, and their encouragement
by the data processing environment.  The economists, with an already
established mathematical orientation, were among the earliest beneficiaries
of the machine technology that enhances their ability to
construct the test models of economic behavior.  Today, statistical
methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for
doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for
one foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in an
appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French or
German in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at
The City University of New York and at other universities.
  The chief function of this directory, in terms of academic supplies
of data, is not to reinventory the social science data archives
that are well-known to the academic community, not to duplicate the
announcements of holdings that they themselves make available to their
members.  The reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature of
their holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to those
researchers, either in or out of the university, who are not sufficiently
aware of these important resources.

The Disadvantaged and Library Effectiveness
.A
Lipsman, c.K.
.W
    The report is concerned with the social utility of libraries and
with the factors that appear to be requirements for effective
programs.  In the absence of established standards or criteria for
measuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis of
a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process;
a survey of needs and interests of the
target groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of the
library's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other
community institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis for
comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides
a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs
of service to the disadvantaged might move.
  To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices
in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities.
In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and
observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of
the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other
available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the
neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the
library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or
effectiveness of the program.

  More than half a century ago La Fontaine and Otlet started
their lives' work, which at first was connected with the term
"bibliography," but to which gradually the work "Documentation"
was attributed.  What they developed was of a far wider scope
than the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed
and non-printed documents.
  The great deal which inspired them, and those who worked
side by side with them, was to render accessible the totality of
what is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a
common treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehension
and to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwill
of all nations.
  It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men,
whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to
see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives.
  And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge
and experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only
gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but
added to it fundamental and constructive new elements.
  Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far
more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Such
a compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiously
enough, up to now, there is no good general treatise on
documentation available.  But his book gives us before all things
an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts.

  The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes, 
methods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing 
documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors: 
  (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the 
acquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information vital
to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an
international scale.
  (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has 
resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.

  Since the first publication of this work Dr. Bradford has
died, and, a further edition now being called for, an attempt
has been made to recognize if not to deal with some criticisms
expressed on the first edition.
  The principal one was that whereas the book was entitled
"Documentation" it dealt in the main with the Universal
Decimal Classification, which Bradford did much to develop,
but that it neglected other aspects and instruments of the
subject of which the UDC is only one, even if an important
one, of various techniques.

Dynamic Information and Library Processing
.A
Salton, G.
.W
  Among the various information processing tasks which may be carried
out with computing equipment, a special class exists for which the term
information takes on the literal and direct sense of recorded knowledge, or
intelligence.  The elements being transformed are then no longer restricted
to mathematical symbols alone, but they may be words and phrases, books,
documents, pictures, and other information carriers.  It is that more
restricted interpretation of an information process which gives rise to the 
field of information science, concerned with the collection, analysis,
classification, storage, retrieval, transmission, and dissemination of
recorded data and intelligence.

Economic Analysis of the Public Libraries
.A
Newhouse, J.P.
.W
  This study addresses itself to several questions important to all public
libraries.  How should the library allocate its book budget?  What kinds of
books should it tend to buy?  What types of households use the library?  Why
do some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the various
services provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library take
to improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among the
different circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books to
be checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is an
investment in a security system worthwhile?
  We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - the
Beverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodology
for determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that arose
during our investigation.  Although answers will vary from library to library,
our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public 
libraries.

Economics of the Academic Libraries
.A 
Baumol, W.J.
.W
  This volume represents what we believe to be as complete
and thorough an analysis as possible of the available economic
data on college and university libraries.  In the course
of our study, we have examined the data for comprehensiveness
and consistency; we have investigated their intertemporal
behavior, both as a basis for projection and as an
instrument for long-range planning; and we have constructed
a set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derive
statistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the most
critical economic variables relating to library operations.  In
particular, in the course of this last step, we have provided
relationships explaining statistically the determination of
such variables as the size of libraries' budgets and the
magnitude of their professional staffs.

Economics of Approval Plans
.A
Spyersduran, P.
.W
  Current budget strains on college and university libraries
require a stepped-up search for operating economies.  The
timely topic of economics of approval plans of the Third
International Conference on Approval and Gathering Plans
for Large and Medium Size Academic Libraries, held at the
Ramada Inn, West Palm Beach, Florida, February 17-19,
1971, has thus generated considerable interest.
  The papers published here constitute, by and large, original
research in this area.  The importance of these contributions
can hardly be overestimated, since they will no doubt mold
and influence collection development practices in the current
imprint area.

Economics of Book Storage
.A
Ellsworth, R.E.
.W
  This report attempts to present and interpret current
(Winter 1968-69) information on the economics of book storage
in relation to the other factors a university administrator
must consider in developing a program for housing an
ever-growing book collection when there are present or
future limitations on space and money.
  The study will attempt to answer two specific questions:
1) Is it economical for colleges and universities to select
so-called little-used books from the regular bookstacks and
store them elsewhere? 2) Is the cost factor the only one a
university need consider in adopting a storage program; and,
if not, how is cost related to the others?
  The facts and conclusions in this report are based on
the library book storage situation as of 1969.  Innovations
in computer applications and other technologies could
presumably change the nature of some of the cost factors, but
it is the author's opinion that these changes unlikely to
occur within the next 5 to 10 years.

Economies and Computers
.A
Sharpe, W.F.
.W
  It is not a simple matter to describe this book.  Briefly, it
attempts to provide and apply a set of concepts from economic theory
that may prove valuable to those who are now or may become decision-
makers in the selection, financing, and/or use of computers.  Only
theory relevant for such decision-makers is presented here.  This means
that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside
the scope of this book, as do a number of related issues.  We deal,
thus, with microeconomic, not macroeconomic, theory: our focus is on the
small (industry, firm, computer) and not the large (gross national
product, consumer price index, unemployment).

Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age
.A
Hitch, C.J.
.W
  The purpose of this book is to explain a way of looking at military
problems which we and others with whom we have been associated have
found fruitful in insights and productive of solutions.  Essentially we
regard all military problems as, in one of their aspects, economic
problems in the efficient allocation and use of resources.  We believe
that this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconciling
the apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who are
responsible for defense and the officials and Congressmen whose primary
interest is economy - except in determining the over-all size of the
military budget, where conflict between these points of view is inevitable.

Educating the Library User
.A
Lubans, J.
.W
  Educating the Library User is a collection of original essays, case
studies, and research reports on the problems, hopes, and techniques of 
instructing library users and nonusers, from the kindergartener to the 
preschool adult, in the effective use of libraries and their resources.
Merging the library-use teachings of school, public, and academic
libraries, this book demonstrates the need for a consistent, sequential
plan of library-use instruction that crosses traditional library boundaries.

Education and Training for Scientific and Technological
Library and Information Work
.A
Schur, M.
.W
  The exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a
phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years.
It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly,
but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming.
In science information this point has now been reached.  To take but one 
field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers
to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million
to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where one
million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and
before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal
to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be
published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began
publication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum
Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only a
further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology
(N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the use
of scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930
the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 the
N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science
Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of
all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period
which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for
peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic
materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).
There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples
may not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at
a very high level indeed.

Some User Requirements Stated Quantitatively 
in Terms of the 90 Percent Library
.A
Bourne, C.P.
.W
  Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very
little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific
requirements for information.  Such information is needed to properly
design or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statements
of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion
rather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been
obtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are
extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and
state user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests an
approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a
method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more
convenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes several
examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that
support these statements.
  In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements
of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious
attempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quite
likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be
extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge.

    Following five years of experience with the mechanization
of procedures using data processing equipment, the university
library in Bochum is attempting to summarize its findings.
A comparison with earlier publications about the use of
electronic data processing equipment shows in what measure
the original plans have actually been affected by the
experience that has been gained.  This summary also serves
as a report for the wider public that may be interested in
technical questions of library processing.

thousands of libraries, research institutes, educational institutions,
professional and trade associations, non-profit organizations, publishing
houses, government agencies, and others.  All of these groups are already
listed in a variety of existing directories.  This publication, on the other
hand, has selected from the above groups, those organizations and services
which are principally concerned with storage, retrieval, and dissemination
of information, and in addition, are innovative, experimental, or non-
conventional.  A major emphasis is on computerization, micrographics, networks,
advanced reference services, information centers, and data banks.
  The Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services includes descriptions
of the following types of services and facilities:

  This publication describes and analyzes approximately 1750 organizations
concerned with new forms, new media, and new methods for providing information
services.  Among these organizations are publishers, computer software and time-
sharing companies, micrographic firms, libraries, information centers, and 
consultants.  The common interest of these diverse organizations is in service
based on storage and representation of structured information with output on a
recurring or demand basis.  The concept of information as used throughout this
book is defined as data organized into a collection of facts and most often
recorded in two basic forms: 1) textual data or literature, and 2) numeric
data.
  Roles played by the organizations described on the following pages vary but
include one or more of the following functions: data base creation, data base
publishing, data transmission, data manipulation and analysis, and data storage
and retrieval.  Emphasis in this publication is on organizations involved in
computerized services, micrographic applications, selective dissemination
of information (SDI), and networking.
  Not included in the Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services are
printed commercial and legal services, traditional academic and special 
libraries, public information offices, hardware manufacturers and distributors
within the computer and micrographic field, conventional indexing and 
abstracting services, and most library automation programs which are limited
to such housekeeping functions as circulation, serials control, and 
acquisitions.

Citation Indexes
.A
Weinstock, M.
.W
  Citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of a
collection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the
more traditional indexing methods.  The primary advantage of citation indexing
is that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked
in a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation 
of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexing
methods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore,
citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not 
vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used
in subject indexes.

Dialog Interactive Information Retrieval System
.A
Summet, R.K.
.W
  DIALOG is the name given to an interactive, computer-based information
retrieval language developed at the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory.  
The DIALOG systems consists of a series of computer programs which have been
designed to make full use of direct access memory devices (in which data 
located anywhere on the device can be accessed in approximately the same amount
of time) and video display units to provide the user a rapid and powerful means
of identifying records within a file which satisfy the particular information
need.  By providing the user full display access to the indexing vocabulary,
and the ability to modify search expressions, DIALOG becomes a data processing
extension of the human operator who directs and controls the process according
to his own personal needs.

Sources of Information on Specific Subjects
.A
Bradford, S.C.
.W
  An alternative hypothesis to
be investigated is that, to a considerable extent, the
references are scattered throughout all periodicals
with a frequency approximately related inversely
to the scope.  On this hypothesis, the aggregate of
periodicals can be divided into classes according to
relevance of scope to the subject concerned, but the
more remote classes will, in the aggregate, produce
as many references as the more related classes.  The
whole range of periodicals thus acts as a family of
successive generations of diminishing kinship, each
generation being greater in number than the
preceding, and each constituent of a generation 
producing inversely according to its degree of
remoteness. 
  The investigation covered, in the first place, the
references quoted, in the course of four and two and
a-half years respectively, by the current bibliographies
of Applied Geophysics and Lubrication, which are 
prepared in the library.  The source of each
reference being given, it was possible to arrange the
sources in order of productivity, the results being
set down in columns A and B of the table, in the
previous column.

Error-correcting Codes
.A
Peterson, W.W.
.W
  Several major developments have contributed to the rapid emergence
of the field of error-correcting codes over the past two decades.
Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost as
dramatically as their size.  This has stimulated the development of digital
computers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramatic
increase in the volume of data communicated between such
machines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in some
cases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either
error-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code in
the terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more 
economical.

The Evaluation of Information Services and Products
.A
King, D.W.
.W
  The continuing need to put scientists in contact with the research of
others, coupled with the rapidly expanding volume of published
material during the past several decades, has placed new emphasis on
the old arts of assembling, coding, and disseminating recorded
knowledge.  In some instances, the emphasis has manifested itself in
research on improvement of traditional library systems.  In other
instances, it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections and
their intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways.  Still other
systems have progressed from the passive role of responding to
requests to the active role of supplying documents, or references to
them, to researchers as the documents become available.  For lack of a
more descriptive terminology, all of these activities are referred to in
this book as "document transfer systems," implying that the product
being retrieved (or disseminated) is a document rather than the
information (if any) in it.  That is, intelligence systems or fact retrieval
systems (if facts are indeed retrieved) are excluded from our concern.
The document, of course, may be a book, a journal article, a drawing,
an abstract, a piece of film, or a piece of magnetic tape.

Evaluation of MEDLARS Documentation
.A
Lancaster, f.W.
.W
  This report presents the results of a detailed analysis by
the National Library of Medicine of the performance of
MEDLARS (its Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval
System) in relation to 300 actual requests made to the
system in 1966 and 1967.  Thanks to this study, we now know
considerably more about the requirements of MEDLARS users,
how well the system is meeting these requirements, and what
we must do to improve the overall performance level.  The
investigation is timely:  the Library is now planning a
second-generation MEDLARS, and the design of MEDLARS II
should benefit greatly from our knowledge of factors affecting
the performance of the present system.

Evaluation of Micropublishing
.A
Veaner, A.B
.W
  Micropublishing, as it pertains to library materials, is essentially
a form of the republishing of materials no longer in print.  The need
for such materials of many kinds - monographs, serials, newspapers,
reference works - has grown greatly during the past quarter century and
this need is reflected in the growth of the micropublishing industry.  As
new colleges and junior colleges are founded, and established colleges
and universities continue to expand to meet growing educational needs,
both groups of institutions find that in more and more instances the
materials they need are available only in microform.  As a result, the
ratio of microforms to books in college and research libraries has been
steadily rising.

Evaluative Research Principles and Practice in Public Service and
Social Action Programs
.A
Suchman, E.A.
.W
  In these days of large government programs intended to reduce poverty,
develop communities, prevent delinquency and crime, control disease, and
reconstruct cities, the predominant rhetoric is that of planning, pilot
projects, experimental and demonstration programs - and evaluation.  Those
who seek to select for support the more promising plans and projects submitted
to funding agencies have become habituated to the ritualistic inclusion in
the proposal of a final section on Evaluation.  In most cases this section
consists of sometimes grandiose but usually vague statements of intent and
procedure for assessing the impact of the proposed action.  In some cases
there is an elegant, highly academic, and impractical scheme worked out in
meticulous detail by an obviously talented research consultant.  In a few
treasured instances there is a well-considered, realistic, and workmanlike
plan for getting some fairly reliable answers to the questions of what worked
and why.

Informal Communication in Science:
Its Advantages and its Formal Analogues
.A
Menzel, H.
.W
    Formal and informal scientific communication are complementary;
they must not be thought of as alternatives in the sense that,
perhaps, certain messages are obtained exclusively through the printed
word, the library, and the mechanized search-and-retrieval system,
whereas others are obtained by the exclusive use of word-of-mouth and
the telephone.  The much more typical event is one in which the receipt
of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two
kinds of communication.  For any given transaction between a scientist
as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that
information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that
may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction
and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen
again with similar results.

The Foundations of Education for Librarianship
.A
Shera, J.H.
.W
    The study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in the
process of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching and
administration, first at the University of Chicago, and subsequently at Western
Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve University, and which has
been elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed.
    My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes
to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role
for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that
role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional
education.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the
communication system within the individual as related to his physiological,
neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and
reading patterns and characteristics.  The study then progresses to an
exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society,
together with the place of the library in it.

A Guide to the Construction and Use of Special Schemes
.A
Vickery, B.C.
.W
  The use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value is
appreciated.  For documentation and information retrieval in
general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and
machine selection are also available.  That classification is of
value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is,
however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistency
and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection
designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce
classificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demand
for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement
and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively
cultivated fields of knowledge.
  It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that
this guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depth
classification have been greatly developed during the past decade,
and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the
traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.
These developments have been reported mainly as research papers
in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily
difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology.
There is a need for a more simply written and more readily
available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of
classification.

Factors Determining the Performance of Indexing Systems
.A
Cleverdon, C.W.

Vol. 1

  The original Aslib-Cranfield investigations on the efficiency of indexing
systems (references 1, 2 and 3) did not, by itself, produce firm answers to 
what is one of the basic problems in information retrieval, namely the 
decision as to which index language should be used.  Certainly it did not, as 
some people had anticipated, demonstrate that one system was 'better' than 
another, either  generally, or in any given situation.

  The test results are presented for a number of different index languages
using various devices which affect recall or precision.  Within the environment
of this test, it is shown that the best performance was obtained with
the group of eight index languages which used single terms.  The group of
fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance,
while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus of
Engineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary.  Of
the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance
was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms
depressed performance.  The use of precision devices such as links gave no
advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination.

Factors in the Transfer of Technology
.A
Gruber, W.H.
.W
  The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country's
research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its
industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact.  Government expenditures
for research and development have increased from a modest
annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today.
The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were
almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today.
These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results,
ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics,
but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product
represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge
whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  The
sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in
which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to
find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the
most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an
increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence
that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  The
value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can
be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of
billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased
technical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting further
economic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a
factor of major importance.

review the history of the struggle for faculty status for
librarians and some of the arguments advanced in support of
that objective; and (2) to gather information on the 
similarities and differences between librarians and faculty 
members in the broad areas of preparation, contributions,
and rewards.  With detailed information on such matters
as education, salaries, professional experience, tenure, sabbaticals,
participation in academic government, and scholarly activity
of librarians and faculty members, one should be able to
judge whether librarians receive unfair or unequal treatment.

Farewell to Alexandria 
Solution to space, growth, and performance problems of libraries
.A
Gore, D.

  The publication of this collection of essays opens a new era for
libraries, taking the first departure in 2,300 years from that durable
model conceived by the librarians of Alexandria and endlessly replicated
by every succeeding generation of librarians, right down to the present
day.  The Alexandrian model persists through the unexamined faith
that to be good a library must be vast and always growing.  The papers
presented here examine that faith scientifically, demonstrate that it
rests on nothing more solid than mistaken intuition, and consign it to
the limbo of outworn dogmas.

A Feasibility Study of Centralized and Regionalized Inter-Library
Loan Centers
.A
Stevens, R.E.
.W
  The two major problems of the present system are (1) the unequal
distribution of lending, with a few of the largest libraries handling
a large proportion of the requests, and (2) the difficulty of filling
requests which are incomplete, incorrect, or inadequately checked.
  Solutions proposed for these two problems have been (1)
compensation to the largest libraries for each transaction, and (2)
better bibliographic checking of requests before they are forwarded to
the lending library.

Biomedical Literature:
Volume, Growth, and Other Characteristics

Orr, R.H.
Leeds, A.A.
.W
  This study's aim was to gather and analyze
reliable data on the quantifiable characteristics of the
biomedical literature that affects communication problems within
the research community.  Previous studies and standard
bibliographic compilations were critically reviewed, particularly
for data that could be used to determine changes with time.
In addition, all publications generated during 1961-1962 by
the extramural and intramural research programs of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) were analyzed as samples
of the current document output of US research.

Formal Languages
.A
Salomaa, A.
.W
  This book develops a theory of formal languages from the point of view of
generative devices, mainly grammars.  Recognition devices, automata, are
introduced only as a secondary tool and are themselves presented within the
framework of rewriting systems.
  The main emphasis is on mathematical aspects of formal languages rather
than application.  People interested only in applications to programming
languages (resp. natural languages) would certainly prefer a more
comprehensive discussion on topics such as LR(k) grammars (resp. 
transformational grammars).  Such discussions lie outside the scope of
this book.

Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata
.A
Hopcroft, J.E.  
.W
  This book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory
and makes explicit its relationship to automata.  The book begins with an
explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language.  The
fundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as
its three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive
grammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics
as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of
automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  These
automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear
bounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered in
detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludes
with certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties,
computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars,
stack automata, and decidability.

Informal Channels of Communication In the Behavioral Sciences:
Their Relevance In the Structuring of Formal or Bibliographic
Communication
.A
Garvey, W.D.
Griffith, B.C.
.W
    What are the needs being served by informal communication?
What can be done about giving informal communication, without
destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of
the advantages of formal communication, such as, general
accessibility, permanence, etc.?  How can formal channels be
manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal
communication?  To cast light on these questions the present
paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within
the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology,
considers the special advantages of informal communication,
and outlines certain relations between informal and formal
channels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments
in scientific communication are described; one experiment being
built about an innovation that attempts to "informalize" formal
channels while the other is built about another innovation that,
in general, attempts to "formalize" an informal channel.

Functional Approach
.A
Sgall, P.
.W
  The present book sums up a certain stage in the research on algebraic
linguistics being pursued at Charles University, Prague.  It is based mainly
on P. Sgall's book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at a
systematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has
gradually been elaborated by our research group.
  We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a
definitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an
articulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be
interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics.
This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing
form of transformational description.  It has not yet been possible to take the
more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their
scope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses are
commented on in the relevant parts of the present book.  We do not present a
complete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart
to the new version of transformational grammar.  We have simply tried
to formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the
development of a new alternative.

Future Developments in Telecommunications
.A
Martin, J.
.W
  Communication technology has entered a period of revolutionary change.
  The last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential.
It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect
they will have on society.
  These inventions include:
  The communication satellite.  Suddenly this has provided telephone
and television links to the underdeveloped world.  Much larger satellites
will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and
communications both in the United States and throughout the world.  The
satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields
ploughed by oxen.
  The helical waveguide.  A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000
simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances.
  The laser.  This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory,
has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls
or their equivalent.
  Large-scale integration (LSI).  A form of ultraminiaturized computer
circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of
computers and computerlike logic circuitry.  It offers the potential of
extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely
fast computers.  If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can
become very low in cost.
  On-line real-time computers.  Computers capable of responding to many
distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human
thinking.  They have the potential of bringing the power and information
of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home.
  Picturephone.  A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers
see as well as hear each other.
  Large TV screens.  TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary.
  Cable TV.  Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying
capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable.  It
could be used for signals other than television.
  Voice answerback.  Computers can now assembly human-voice words and
speak them over the telephone.  This fact, coupled with the Touchtone
telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal.
  Millimeter-wave radio.  Radio at frequencies in the band above the
microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the
other radio bands combined.  Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute
these millimeter-wave signals.
  Pulse code modulation.  All signals, including telephone, Picturephone,
music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream
and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links.
Major advantages accrue from this.
  Computerized switching.  Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into
operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and
"concentrating" all types of signals.
  Data banks.  Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that
can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a
fraction of a second.

Future Shock
.A
Toffler, A.
.W
  This is a book about what happens to people when they are
overwhelmed by change.  It is about the ways in which we adapt
- or fail to adapt - to the future.
  Much has been written about the future.  Yet, for the most
part, books about the world to come sound a harsh metallic note.
These pages, by contrast, concern themselves with the "soft" or
human side of tomorrow.  Moreover, they concern themselves
with the steps by which we are likely to reach tomorrow. They
deal with common, everyday matters - the products we buy and
discard, the places we leave behind, the corporations we inhabit,
the people who pass at an ever faster clip through our lives.  The
future of friendship and family life in probed.  Strange new
subcultures and life styles are investigated, along with an array of
other subjects from politics and playgrounds to skydiving and sex.

and evaluate the position of the public library in the structure
of government in the United States.  The use of the word
"government" in the title, therefore, is deliberate.  We are
here concerned with the legal forms and types of governmental
organization of the public library and with its relation to
the city or other political unit to which it is attached or
which it serves.

Government Publications:  A Guide to Bibliographic Tools
.A
Palic, V.M.
.W
  The expansion of government at all levels - international, national,
provincial or state, and local - has resulted in increasing government
influence on the life of each citizen.  Concomitant with this development
is the proliferation of published directives, regulations, reports,
technical studies, and other informational issuances in such volume that no
one engaged in a business or profession, no financial tycoon, educator,
researcher, farmer, housewife, welfare recipient, or unemployed person can
function without some reference to government publications.  Yet, in few
areas of recorded human knowledge have control and bibliographic aids
been so little systemized. 
  The present work, designed to provide the prospective user as well as
the trained researcher and librarian with a guide to the maze, is a direct
descendant of the Childs essay.  The extent to which the mass of published
material has grown is underscored by the contrasting physical size of the
two publications; Childs' was a 78-page pamphlet containing approximately
400 entries whereas this book of over 400 pages cites more than 3,000 titles.

to provide the reader with an understanding of the characteristics of the
classification, the arrangement within the classes, the format of the schedules
and tables, and special problems of use and notation.  The reader should trace
the analysis of each example of classing through the pages from the L.C. 
schedule provided in the guide.  It is important to remind the reader that a
thorough study of each class schedule in addition to the recommended readings
is essential.  The author realizes that many imperfections may be present in
this guide and will appreciate suggestions for changes from readers.

Guide to Reference Books
.A
Winchell, C.M.
.W
  The fundamental principles of reference work remain
more or less constant through the years, but the rapid
expansion of the publication of reference books in all
fields makes essential a careful selection to fit the needs
of each library.  The purpose of this volume is to list
reference books basic to research - general and special -
and thus to serve as: (1) a reference manual for the
library assistant, research worker, or other user of
library resources; (2) a selection aid for the librarian; and
(3) a textbook for the student, who, either in library
school, training class, or college course in bibliography,
is pursuing a systematic study of reference books.
  The needs of these types of users have influenced the
organization and make-up of this volume, in that the
requirements of the first two groups have made the
manual more comprehensive than it might have been if
intended for a textbook only, while the introductions to
sections and many of the annotations have been provided
particularly for the library school student.

Task Force of the Federal Library Committee, sponsored and monitored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and carried out by the System Development 
Corporation.  The project included a questionnaire survey of all Federal
libraries (2104), as of December, 1970, to gather systems planning data and 
to identify Federal libraries with operational or planned automated systems.
Respondents in the latter group were sent a Federal Library Automation Survey
questionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems.
From these sources, amplified by visits to Federal libraries and an extensive
review of the automation literature, information was distilled for use in
this Handbook.

Handbook of Comparative Librarianship
.A
Simsova, S.
.W
  The first part, written by myself, deals with 'Comparative
librarianship and comparative method' and is intended for both
teachers of comparative librarianship and their students.  It can be
approached in a number of ways:  The first three chapters outline
comparative librarianship and the theoretical basis of its
methodology against the wider background of other comparative sciences
and the scientific method.  The three chapters following are purely
practical and explain the various steps of writing a comparative
study.  The last chapter is intended for teachers.
  The second part, compiled by Mrs. MacKee, is a bibliographical
guide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world.
It draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianship
students in the course of their project work, on replies to a
questionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world,
and on Mrs. MacKee's own collection of references gathered over a
number of years.

Handbook of Data Processing for Libraries
.A
Hayes, R.M.
.B
1970
.W
  The purpose of this book, therefore, is to assist libraries and librarians in
resolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology.  The
intent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methods
available for the application of modern data processing to library operations.
For the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool to
guide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques
into his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating him
not only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data 
processing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summary
of the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives and
the technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and,
particularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determining
the choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always in
the context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems,
as an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of good
management, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims to
educate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problems
of applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork has
already been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried out
analyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and is
developing better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues a
process that is already underway.

HDB of Data Processing for Libraries
.A
Hayes, R.M.
.W
  The four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a
period of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries.  Where
one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate
each kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre of
knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtually
every major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts at
that time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth.
This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different
from that of the first.
  But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and that
students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge
of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems
analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library's
processing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore represent
not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, to
reflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correct
the errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the first
edition.

Handbook of Medical Library Practice
.A
Annan, G.L.
.W
  The Medical Library Association has long been aware of the need for a
third edition of the Handbook.  Changes in library practices, proliferating
demands upon established libraries, and the development of new ones
created the need of an up-to-date tool.  Like the earlier editions,
this Handbook is such a tool, a manual, not a survey of the state of the
art.  It offers practical advice to all - fledgling librarians starting
their careers, experienced librarians transferring to the field of
health sciences, established medical librarians refreshing memories or
adopting procedures unfamiliar to them, and specialists in related fields.

Handbook of the National and International Libraries

Fang, J.R.

  Two methods were used:  (1) A thorough search of professional
literature, principally since 1965, with exceptions in
cases where no later information was available, and (2) direct
communication with associations through a questionnaire and
consultation of supplementary material provided by the associations.
The final result of the authors' search was a total of 319
library associations, 33 international in scope and 286 national
(see Statistical Data).

The Hidden Dimension
.A
Hall, E.T.
.W
  Generally speaking, there are two types of books of interest to the
serious reader today:  those that are content oriented, designed to
convey a particular body of knowledge, and those that deal with structure,
the way in which events are organized.  It is doubtful if an author 
has any control over which of these two types of books he writes,
though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference.  The same
applies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his
unstated expectations.  In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmed
with data from many sources, it is easy to understand why people
are apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in
their own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awareness
of a loss of relatedness to the world at large.  This loss of relatedness
leads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid
in intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man
must cope. The Hidden Dimension attempts to provide just this.

Historical Introduction to Library School
.A
White, C.M.
.W
    This is a revision and enlargement of Origins of the American Library
School.
    Someone has observed that the roots of the present lie deep in the
past and must be uncovered to understand fully how the present came to
be what it is.  This study is less a descriptive history of library schools
and their work than a search for perspective within which major problems,
as well as the course pursued in resolving them, can be more fully
understood.  The original study, begun in 1941-42, sought to throw light
on how library education at that time came to be what is was.  The
present study continues beyond the early forming of the American library
school to the reforming of basic lines of policy and organization.  A new
title is used to reflect the broadened scope.

The History of Libraries in the Western World
.A
Johnson, E.D.
.W
    The present work is an attempt to trace the history of libraries
in the western world:  to indicate how libraries developed and how
they influenced the social and cultural history of our civilization.
The book is intended for the student of library science or of cultural
history and for the general reader interested in the development of western
civilization.  Much has been omitted concerning libraries and librarians
that could have been included; conversely, some facts could have been
omitted without seriously detracting from the story as a whole but have
been included to illustrate how library history developed; they point out
the high spots and indicate trends.

Human Behavior and the Principles of Least Effort 
An Introduction to Human Ecology
.A
Zipf, G.K.
.W
  Nearly twenty-five years ago it occurred to me that we might gain 
considerable insight into the mainsprings of human behavior if we viewed it
purely as a natural phenomenon like everything else in the universe, and if
we studied it with the same dispassionate objectivity with which one is wont
to study, say, the social behavior of bees, or the nestbuilding habits of
birds.  The present book reports the results of the extended inquiry that
ensued in the course of those years, and which led to the disclosure of
some fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of our
behavior, both as individuals and as members of social groups.

Human Problem Solving
.A
Newell, A.
Simon, H.A.
.W
    The present study is concerned with the performance of intelligent adults
in our own culture.  The tasks discussed are short (half-hour), moderately
difficult problems of a symbolic nature.  The three main tasks we use - chess,
symbolic logic, and algebra-like puzzles (called cryptarithmetic puzzles) -
typify this class of problems.  The study is concerned with the integrated
activities that constitute problem solving.  It is not centrally concerned
with perception, motor skill, or what are called personality variables.
The study is concerned primarily with performance, only a little with
learning, and not at all with development or differences related to age.
Finally, it is concerned with integrated activities, hence deemphasizes the
details of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions (that is,
half a second or less).  Similarly, long-term integrated activities extending
over periods of days or years receive no attention.

The Human Side of Enterprise
.A
McGregor, D.
.W
    This volume is an attempt to substantiate the thesis that the
human side of enterprise is "all of a piece" - that the theoretical
assumptions management holds about controlling its human resources
determine the whole character of the enterprise.  They determine
also the quality of its successive generations of management.
    Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibility
and the hope of future progress.  The key question for top management
is:  "What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about
the most effective way to manage people?"  From the answer to this
question flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in our
discussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to many
other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to
achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  It
will be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptions
about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate.

A Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary 
Information
.A
Luhn, H.P.
.W
   Written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical 
probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that
combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning.. Since this
process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed
of different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem
of literature searching by machines still present major difficulties.. A 
statistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various steps
of a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the 
statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the 
establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are
expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the
automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary,
the encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the 
recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern 
for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines
to carry out a search..

The Automatic Creation of Literature Abstracts
.A
Luhn, H.P.
.W
   Experts of technical papers and magazine articles that serve the purposes of
conventional abstracts have been created entirely by automatic means.. In the
exploratory research described, the complete text of an article in machine-
readable form is scanned by an IBM 704 data-processing machine and analyzed 
in accordance with a standard program..  Statistical information derived from 
word frequency and distribution is used by the machine to compute a relative 
measure of significance, first for individual words and then for sentences..
Sentences scoring highest in significance are extracted and printed out to 
become the "auto-abstract"..

A Business Intelligence System
.A
Luhn, H.P.
.W
   An automatic system is being developed to disseminate information to the 
various sections of any industrial, scientific or government organization.. 
This intelligence system will utilize data-processing machines for auto-
abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles
for each of the "action points" in an organization.. Both incoming and 
internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a
word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points.. This paper
shows the flexibility of such a system in identifying known information, in
finding who needs to know it and in disseminating it efficiently either in 
abstract form or as a complete document..

On Some Clustering Techniques
.A
Bonner, R.E.
.W
   The problem of organizing a large mass of data occurs frequently in 
research.. Normally, some process of generalization is used to compress the 
data so that it can be analyzed more easily.. A primitive step in this process 
is the "clustering" technique, which involves gathering together similar data 
into a cluster to permit a significant generalization..
   This paper describes a number of methods which make use of IBM 7090 computer
programs to do clustering.. A medical research problem is used to illustrate
and compare these methods..

R and D Project Selection:  Where We Stand

Baker, N.R.
Pound, W.H.
.W
   A review of the literature on R and D project selection and an analysis of 
interview data suggest that there is a lack of testing and use of the methods
proposed.. Several OR-MS methods are identified and their current status is
indicated.. Three representative procedures are examined in some detail.. It is
argued that both a lack of testing concerning feasibility and shortcomings of
the models themselves, help to explain why the methods have not been used.. 
Some of these shortcomings are identified and discussed.. Implications for 
future research are presented..

A Method for Allocating R & D Expenditures
.A
Rosen, E.M.
Souder, W.E.
.W
   The analytical problems of developing quantitative techniques for R & D 
investment management are often complicated by the existence of conflicting 
goals.. Corporate goals may require the R & D  manager to simultaneously seek
the highest probable profits, the largest probable number of successes, and the
greatest probable profit per dollar spent.. Departmental goals may restrict the
manager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on, 
and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects.. In a sense, then, 
the research manager is faced with a constrained multiple-output production 
problem: how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall.. 
This  paper shows how a slight modification of Hess' approach to project
selection  and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple-product
factory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solve
these project selection, resource allocation, and budget determination 
problems..  Most approaches in the literature have treated these three problems
separately..

The Effects of Perceived Need and Means on the Generation of Ideas for
Industrial Research and Development Projects
.A
Baker, Norman R.
Siegman, Jack
Rubenstein, Albert H.
.W
   A flow model is presented which identifies some of the organizational 
factors influencing idea generation behavior in industrial R&D laboratories.. 
The model is constructed from literature-based propositions which make 
explicit the role played by several organizational factors identified in the
model.. Data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional 
laboratory of a major U.S. corporation.. In general, these data support the
a priori propositions.. Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces of
information are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need,
problem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means or
technique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on the 
opportunity.. These results are discussed with respect to the stage of creative
thought proposed by other investigators.. Finally, the organizational events,
which were associated as "needs" events or "means" events for the ideas studies,
are identified and analyzed with respect to both quantity and quality of ideas..

The Validity of Subjective Probability of Success Forecasts
by R & D Project Managers
.A
Souder, W.D.
.W
    Models and techniques to aid management in planning
controlling R&D projects frequently use subjective probability of
success forecasts as one of the major inputs.  An experiment was
conducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company to
measure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts.
The results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certain
types of R&D projects can be predicted by measuring the time shape
of polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of success
forecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators than
several commonly used project status measures.  These results tend
to support the hypothesis that R&D planning and control models that
are based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be used
by management to aid in early identification of eventually failing
projects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding.

they are based on linear, integer, chance constrained, or dynamic programming..
Representative examples from these classes are described and evaluated in 
detail.. The evaluation is on terms of data requirements; built-in assumptions;
ease of computation; usefulness of outputs; versatility of application..

The Information Content of Titles in Engineering Literature
.A
Bottle, Robert T. 
.W
   Since many alerting and information services rely very heavily on the use
of titles to transfer information to the potential user, it is essential that 
he be aware of the proportion of the information contained in the complete
document which will not be deducible from the title and which he will therefore
miss.. Methods will be discussed for analyzing the relative information content
of the titles of engineering paper and results presented for the amount and 
type of information lost through scanning title listing only..
   Between one-third and one-half of indexable terms are not retrievable from
article titles even if all possible synonyms and  related terms are used.. If
all synonyms are used instead of one keyword the amount of information 
retrieved is increased by about 70 percent.. The problems of dealing with
synonyms and with syntactical variants in searching titles indexes are 
discussed.. The possibility of using keywords in journal titles as 
supplementary retrieval tags is suggested since they were deemed useful in
nearly one-third of the sample of papers analyzed..

On Fuzzy Mapping and Control

   A fuzzy mapping from X to Y is a fuzzy set on X * Y.. The concept is 
extended to fuzzy mappings of fuzzy set on X to Y, fuzzy function and its 
inverse, fuzzy parametric function, fuzzy observation, and control.. Set
theoretical relations are obtained for fuzzy mappings, fuzzy functions, and 
fuzzy parametric functions.. It is shown that under certain conditions a 
precise control goal can be attained with fuzzy observation and control as long 
as the observations become sufficiently precise when the goal is approached..

Cooperation Between Types of Libraries An annotated bibliography
1969-1971 supplement
.A
Gilluly, M.E.
Wert, L.M.
.W
  This bibliography is designed to supplement capitalize Between Types of 
Libraries 1940-1956 An Annotated Bibliography by Ralph H. Stenstrom.  The staff
of the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois in cooperation
with the Illinois State Library plans to issue an annual supplement which will 
appear in Illinois libraries each year.  It is hoped the supplements issued in 
this manner can be cumulated periodically and issued in monograph form.

Illustrative Computer Programming for Libraries
.A
Davis, C.H.
.W
  Illustrative Computer Programming is intended as
a graded workbook or text supplement containing
typical practical problems, suggested solutions, and
tried analyses which emphasize programming efficiency
and some of the major features of PL/I (Programming
Language/One).  As such, it can be used alone or in
combination with established PL/I textbooks such as
those listed in the Selected Bibliography.  Programmers
with knowledge of other languages will not be bothered
by excessive introductory material, while beginners can
learn much by looking at the solutions to the problems
and their accompanying analyses.

Improving Access to Library Resources
.A
Dougherty, R.M.
.W
    The motivation for this investigation derived from a
series of visits to institutions which were deeply committed
to the design, development, and operation of non-traditional
automated information systems.  At the time of the visits,
the systems seemed to be working technically but, paradoxically,
they did not appear to have made a significant impact on the
respective user communities.  Although few people associated
with the systems openly expressed concern, there were non-verbal
indicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous.
Since all of the systems represented high expenditures of time
and money, a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate.

Indexing Languages and Thesauri: Construction and Maintenance
.A
Soergel, D.
.W
  This book has two objectives.  First, to reassess thoroughly the functions
of an indexing language or thesaurus in a information storage and retrieval
system and in the light of this reassessment to analyze the structure of 
indexing languages and thesauri.  Most importantly, this reassessment is based
on a unified view of indexing languages (classification schemes) and thesauri 
as information storage and retrieval systems on the other.  It results in 
general principles that are applicable to a wide range of situations.

Industrial Research and Technological Innovation an Econometric Analysis
.A
Mansfield, E.
.W
   After many years of neglect, technological change is receiving the attention
from economists that it deserves, the 1960's being a time of a enormous 
interest in this area in academic, government, and business circles.. Central 
to the economics of technological change is the manner in which new processes
and products are conceived, developed, commercialized, and accepted.. To help
promote a better understanding of this process, I have been engaged for a 
number of years in a series of related econometric studies of industrial 
research and technological innovation.. The purpose of this book is to bring
together the results of these studies..

Industry and Technical Progress
.A
Carter, C.F.
.W
  This book is written in the belief that the full and speedy application
of science in industry is necessary to economic progress, and
should indeed be one of the most important objectives of national
policy.  This being so, it is important to identify the hindrances to
speedy application.  Many people have already drawn attention to
particular hindrances but the three bodies which have sponsored this report
did not consider that there was any up-to-date assessment of the problem
which attempted to look at it as a whole, in all its variety and complexity.
Hence the investigation which they undertook, and largely entrusted to us;
an investigation which, through the great goodwill of many people in British
industry, has yielded so much material that this book can only be a first
impression and summary.

Inequality; a reassessment of the effect of family and schooling in America
.A
Jenchs, C.
.W
  This book summarizes the results of three years of research at the
Center for Educational Policy Research.  The eight coauthors were all
Research Associates at the Center, and our work there was a collaborative
effort.  We plagiarized both ideas and data from one another.  Most of
us also spent a good deal of time criticizing one another's work.  While
each of us took primary responsibility for certain lines of inquiry, and
this responsibility is recorded in appropriate footnotes, we see our
research as an integrated effort which should bear all our names.

Research Studies in Patterns of Scientific Communication: I.
General Description of Research Program

Garvey, William D.

Tomita, Kazuo

   This article is the first in a series which described the general procedures 
and some findings of over seventy studies which we conducted from 1966 to 1971 
on the information-exchange activities of over 12000 scientists and engineers 
in a sample of nine physical, social and engineering sciences.. We designed the
studies so that (a) the full spectrum of scientific communication media could 
be explored, (b) the various studies were coupled in order that data obtained
from one study could be directly related to those obtained from other studies,
(c) the scheduling of the studies was conducted in real time in order that the 
same body of information could be followed from its inception to its final 
integration into the general body of scientific knowledge, and (d) the same 
studies were conducted for all nine disciplines being studied in order that 
genuine comparisons could be made among them.. The data are now stored on
machine-readable magnetic tapes and will be made available to scholars in the 
field of information science..

The Continuity of Dissemination of Information by "Productive Scientists"
.A
Garvey, William D.
Lin, Nan
Tomita, Kazuo
.W
   This article is the last in series which describes a set of studies which
were conducted over a 4,5-year period (1966-1971).. The series of articles 
sought to describe a comprehensive picture of the dissemination and assimilation
of scientific information as it flows through various informal and formal media,
from the time a scientist initiates his work until it is published.. The 
present article examines the continuity of scientific work and information 
exchange by "productive scientists" two years after the publication of their 
articles in 1968/1969.. The results indicate that about half of the authors had
changed to a subject-matter area which differed from that of their earlier
articles, however, such shifts did not decrease authors' productivity nor 
greatly increase their information needs..

Inference and Disputed Authorship
.A 
Mosteller, F.
.W
  We apply a 200-year-old mathematical theorem to a 175-year-old historical
problem, more to advance statistics than history.  Though problems of disputed
authorship are common in history, literature, and politics, scholars regard their
solutions as minor advances.  For us the question of whether Hamilton or
Madison wrote the disputed Federalist papers has served as a laboratory and
demonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods.
While we help solve this historical problem, our practical application of Bayes'
theorem to a large analysis of data is a step in testing the feasibility of a
method being explored with fresh attitudes and fresh mathematics.  Furthermore,
large practical applications have until now been few, and our work helps fill
that gap.

Storage Analysis of a Compression Coding for Document Data Bases
.A
Heaps, H.S.
.W
   Analysis is made of the effect of using an efficient code of compression of
terms within a document data base.. The storage efficiency  is expressed in 
terms of the vocabulary length and the values of certain parameters which 
describe the structure of the code.. For vocabularies of up to 100,000 terms
the average code length is approximately twelve bits.. No information is lost
through term truncation or abbreviation.. The tables required for coding and 
decoding may be ordered for rapid access without reduction in the ease of 
update..

Quantitative Fuzzy Semantics
.A
Zaden, L.A.
.W
   The point of departure in this paper is the definition of a language, L, as
a fuzzy relation from a set of terms, T = {x}, to a universe of discourse, 
U = {y}.. As a fuzzy relation, L is characterized by its membership function
mL:T*U -> [0,1], which associates with each ordered pair (x,y) its grade of 
membership, mL(x,y), in L.. 
   Given a particular x in T, the membership function mL(x,y) defines a fuzzy
set, M(x), in U whose membership function is given by mM(x)(y) = mL(X,y)..
The fuzzy set M(x) is defined to be the meaning of the term x, with x playing 
the role of a name for M(x)..
   If a term x in T is a concatenation of other terms in T, that is,
x = x1 ... xn, xi  T, i epsilon 1,...,n, then the meaning of x can be expressed in 
terms of the meanings of x1,...,xn through the use of a lambda-expression or by
solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are 
deduced from the syntax tree of x.. The use of this approach is illustrated by 
examples..

On Relevance as a Measure
.A
Coffman, William
.W
   Relevance is defined as a measure of information conveyed by a document 
relative to a query.. It is shown that the relationship between the document 
and the query, though necessary, is not sufficient to determine relevance..

A Definition of Relevance for Information Retrieval
.A
Cooper, W.S.
.W
   The concept of "relevance", sometimes also called "pertinence" or 
"aboutness", is central to the theory of information retrieval.. Unfortunately,
however, there is at present no consensus as to how this notion should be 
defined.. The purpose of this paper is to propose and defend a definition of
what it means to say that a piece of stored information is "relevant" to the
information need of a retrieval system user..
   The suggested definition explicates relevance in terms of logical 
implication.. For one yes-or-no question answering system which operates with
one of the standard formalized languages, the definition provides a 
mathematically precise criterion of relevance.. For other types of fact 
retrieval systems and reference retrieval systems, including all systems whose 
stored information is expressed in natural language, the definition is not  
mathematically precise but is nevertheless still helpful on a conceptual 
level..

Computer Assisted Indexing
.A
Gray, W. A.
.W
   The paper describes a technique which enables an on line computer based
information retrieval system to aid the indexers by selecting possible index 
terms to be assigned to a new document entering the system..
   The method analyses the index terms assigned to the references cited by the 
new article.. This produces a list of index terms weighted according to their 
expected correlation with the subject matter of the new article.. Thus, the 
indexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an 
aid..
   An evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trial
set of documents.. These documents have already been indexed for the MEDLARS 
system.. The list of actual index terms for this trial set of documents is 
compared with the set of index terms proposed by the technique for each 
document.. The results of this comparison are encouraging, and they are 
discussed in the paper..
   The economic aspects of implementing the technique in a working information 
retrieval system is considered.. This included the expected benefits, and an 
estimate of the cost of using the technique as an aid in terms of computer 
time and indexer time..

A Note on the Concept of "Relevance"
.A
Foskett, D.J.
.W
  Two recent articles in this journal (Konigova [1], Cooper [2]) have gone
beyond the usual slapdash use of the words "relevant" and "relevance," and
have attempted to explicate the concept further.  Both attempts only partially
succeed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/content
relevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification has
validity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less
precise language; for example, in defining "second order noise," she uses the
ambiguous phrase "a formally relevant document which is not really relevant" -
presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of
the enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, "no account is taken of
the subjective relevance (pertinence)."  Yet this is surely the true aim of the
system.

An Evaluation of Query Expansion by the Addition of Clustered Terms 
   for a Document Retrieval System
.A
Minker, Jack
Wilson, Gerald A.
Zimmerman, Barbara H.
.W
   An evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be 
extracted from an automatically indexed document collection, and the effects of 
employing such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described.. The graph 
theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different 
cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data.. The 
clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to 
determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results..
   Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were
obtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance 
were achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the 
retrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can be
obtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters 
and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use
in an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and 
the  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or 
other  situations..

Situational Relevance
.A
Wilson, Patrick
.W
   The concept of situational relevance is introduced, based on W.S.Cooper's
definitions of logical relevance, on the notion of evidential relevance drawn
from inductive logic, on the notions of a personal stock of knowledge and a set 
of personal concerns, the latter explained in terms of preferences over ranges 
of alternatives.. Situationally relevant items of information are those that 
answer, or logically help to answer, questions of concern.. Significant 
situationally relevant information is explained in terms of changes of view in 
relation to questions of concern.. It is claimed that situational relevance is 
an explication of the ordinary notion of practical relevance, and that it is 
the appropriate relevance concept to use in evaluation of systems supplying 
practically relevant information..

Selection of Equifrequent Word Fragments for Information Retrieval
.A
Schuegraf, E. J.
Heaps, H. S.
.W
   The design of programs to research large document data bases is discussed 
with regard to the use of compression coding combined with adoption of word 
fragments as the basic language elements.. An algorithm is described for 
determination of a set of almost equifrequent fragments.. Its efficiency is 
tested for a sample data base formed from the MARC tapes.. A certain threshold 
frequency acts as a parameter whose value determines the number of distinct 
fragments.. The selection algorithm is designed to give some preference to 
choice of the longest fragments and hence allow compact coding of the data base 
by concatenation of non-overlapping fragments..

Interaction Between Requesters and a Large Mechanized retrieval System
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
   In a large mechanized retrieval system, a certain proportion of the search
failures are likely to be directly attributable to inadequate user-system 
interaction.. Request statements may be only distant  approximations of
actual information requirements.. This paper discusses some of the problems of
the user-system interface and suggests methods whereby these problems may be
alleviated..

The U.S. National Library of Medicine and International MEDLARS Cooperation
.A
Corning, Mary E.
.W
   The U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) initiated its computer-based 
bibliographic information storage and retrieval system, MEDLARS, in 1964..
Currently, The NLM has eight international MEDLARS quid-pro-quo arrangements 
with the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, West Germany, Japan, Australia, Canada
and the World Health Organization.. The policy aspects of the arrangements are
discussed as well as the organizational and operational characteristics of 
these non-U.S. MEDLARS Centers..

Information in 1985; a forecasting study of
information needs and resources
.A
Anderla, G.
.W
    The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the supply of,
and above all the demand for, scientific and technical information;
its secondary objective is to make a long-term assessment of
qualitative and quantitative requirements for information specialists.
In both instances, of course, future technical developments, as far
as they can be foreseen, must be taken into account.
    At the same time, like most work sponsored by the OECD, its aim
is to identify significant criteria for defining a policy - in this
case an information policy, which is greatly needed in all OECD countries.

Information Analysis and Retrieval
.A
Kent, A.
.W
    Therefore the purpose of this book remains the same as that of Textbook on
Mechanized Information Retrieval - to teach basics to those who have had no
previous exposure either to the field or to computers, or both.  Therefore,
the action is slowed to the point where the logical principles of information
retrieval systems are laid bare.  Other books have been published that emphasize
computer programming - this one does not.

Fuzzy Sets
.A
Zaden, L. A.
.W
   A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership..
Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which 
assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one.. The
notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, 
etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the
context of fuzzy sets are established.. In particular, a separation theorem for
convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint..

Information and Its User
.A
Brittain, J.M.
.W
  In science and technology user studies are numerous and have a
history of some twenty years.  The relevance of the methodology
of science user studies to the social sciences is considered in 
Chapter 2.  The pressing need in user studies, in science as well
as social science, is for a general body of theory about the flow
of information in research and teaching communities.  Some of the
fundamental characteristics of social science research and its
literature which have a bearing upon investigations of information
needs and requirements are considered in the first part of Chapter
3, and the second part is devoted to a review of empirical studies
in the social sciences.  Other relevant material about the use made
of information is discussed in Chapter 4 on systematic approaches.

Information, Mechanism, and Meaning
.A
Mackay, D.M.
.W
  In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to
keep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, the
publication of collected papers, like the estate of holy
matrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly,
lightly or wantonly'.  In the present case it would not have been
considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected
friend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement
alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel
for our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this
first volume to the point of no return.  It is true that these
exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably 
awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to
follow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them were
written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some
rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting
repetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasional
exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only
at the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solution
adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages
intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped
without loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where some
comment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or 
postscript to the original papers, the passages added have
been italicized.

Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
  This book is concerned primarily with those "intellectual" factors that
significantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems;
namely,

        - indexing policy and practice
        - vocabulary control
        - searching strategies
        - interaction between the system and its users

  My viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems.  I have
therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements
of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance
in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements.
  The book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with equipment
for the implementation of retrieval systems, a topic that is adequately
covered by other volumes in this seris.  Moreover, it is my contention that
the importance of "hardware" and "data processing" aspects of information
systems has been exaggerated in the United States, with some detriment
to the performance of many systems.

Information Retrieval On-Line
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
    This book deals with on-line systems for bibliographic search and
retrieval.  The literature on this subject is increasing rapidly and new systems
are appearing all the time.  We have attempted to provide a broad survey of
the characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of present systems.  Our
emphasis is on the design, evaluation, and use of on-line retrieval systems,
primarily from the viewpoint of the planner and manager of information
services.  It is oriented toward the "intellectual" aspects of information
retrieval rather than the hardware or programming aspects.  We hope that
this book may have some value for all students of library and information
science.

Information Retrieval and Documentation in Chemistry
.A
Davis, C.H.
.W
  For several years we have thought that greater effort should be
expended to create more understanding of the processes involved in
information storage, retrieval, and dissemination.  Too often, concepts
deriving from science and technology are made to seem unnecessarily
abstruse, either inadvertently or deliberately to preserve some sort of
mystique.  This book is intended to explicate, if not popularize, major
aspects of I S & R processes as they are exemplified by the field of
chemical documentation.  To the extent that this work is found useful
by chemists, information specialists, and all individuals interested in
scientific documentation, we shall be gratified.

Information Retrieval and Processing
.A
Doyle, L.B.
.W
    The present book embodies a change in structure and focus to reflect
the fact that the reader of today's book is much more likely to be an
interested college student with a great awareness of the current information
revolution than was the case ten years ago.  Thus, hardware, materials, and
processes used in connection with information systems are discussed first,
in Chapters Two through Four.  The subject of information retrieval per se
begins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship 
and documentation.  Because of their somewhat historical slant, these
chapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 book
which adhere to their original character.  Chapter Seven presents a simplified
concept of an information system and its components, and paves the way for
discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especially
for data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine.
Chapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and user
studies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have
developed strongly since 1963.

Van Rijsbergen, C.J.

  The material of this book is aimed at advanced undergraduate
information (or computer) science students, postgraduate library
science students, and research workers in the field of IR.  Some of the
chapters, particularly Chapter 6, make simple use of a little advanced
mathematics.  However, the necessary mathematical tools can be easily
mastered from numerous mathematical texts that now exist and in any
case references have been given where the mathematics occur.

Information Retrieval; British and American, 1876-1976
.A
Metcalfe, J.
.W
        Of eight chapters this first one deals with principles and
definitions and then with the slow development of information
retrieval through about 5,000 years until the introduction of
printing in Europe less than 500 years prior to our period
of principal coverage, 1876-1976.  This latter period coincides
with the second century of the United States of America,
during which were intensified earlier efforts to carry out one of
Washington's urgings in his Farewell Address:  "Promote
then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion
of knowledge."

Similarity Relations and Fuzzy Orderings
.A
Zaden, L. A.
.W
   The notion of "similarity" as defined in this paper is essentially a 
generalization of the notion of equivalence.. In the same vein, a fuzzy ordering
is a generalization of the concept of ordering.. For example, the relation 
x >> y is a fuzzy linear ordering in the set of real numbers..
   More correctly, a similarity relation, S is a fuzzy relation which is
reflexive, symmetric, and transitive..
   Various properties of similarity relations and fuzzy ordering are 
investigated and, as an illustration, an extended version of Szpilrajn's 
theorem is proved..

   An outline is given of the history of the Project and the development, with 
OSTI support, of an information service in intestinal absorption which is intended
to become self-supporting.. Results of an evaluation of computer-based current 
awareness techniques including journal scanning is discussed with reference to 
cost, completeness and minimum delay.. A simple technique is suggested for
profile construction e.g. for Chemical Titles computer search, based on 
frequency and specificity of words in a sample of relevant titles..

Analysis of On-line Searching Costs
.A
Robertson, S.E.
Datta, S.
.W
   A project was undertaken to discover the major determinants of the costs of 
searching, on-line, on a practical reference retrieval system (SCISEARCH).. The
methodology and some results of this project are reported.. Controlled searches
were undertaken to isolate the effect of each of a number of variables.. A 
model involving several of the major variables was then developed.. The general
approach proved to be (in this case) both feasible and useful..

Information Service in Libraries
.A
Crowley, T.
.W
        The two studies presented here represent efforts
to measure the performance of library staffs in an unobstrusive
fashion:  that is, to apply certain tests generally
similar to portions of the normal workload without drawing
attention to the fact that a test is being carried out.  The
two projects were rather different as to purpose, method,
and reliability of result (that is, statistical significance).
Dr. Crowley's investigation, the first in point of time,
arose partly from his experience in a county library.  His
curiousity about the real result of the reference activities
(as different from merely counting the questions answered)
led him to ask, "Is there substantial difference between the
claims made by librarians for reference work and the actual
result as observed in a number of different situations by
individuals posing as clients?"  The study which followed
from this question was, then, exploratory and necessarily
less rigidly controlled than was the second study of this
pair.

Information Storage and Retrieval:
tools, elements, theories
.A
Becker, J.
.W
  This textbook grew out of some discussions between the authors
about the interdisciplinary character of the field of information storage
and retrieval.  We both felt that the need existed to show what
each professional group concerned with the solution of information
storage and retrieval problems could contribute.  A university-level
course was developed, based on the concept that each person should
be made aware of how others could help him.  The course was presented
about a dozen times over the ensuing years, and this book is based on it.

ways and means of accomplishing this, and these methods of improving
the organization and retrieval of personal document collections are the
principal topics to be covered.  The book is addressed primarily to the
researcher in any subject field who desires to improve the index to his
document collection or start an index to his document collection but does
not quite know how to go about it.  An index is herein defined as a
systematic organization of a collection of documents or data.  There are
indexes to various types of document and data collections, and there are
various types of indexes.  Examples of familiar indexes are indexes to
individual books, to collections of books (the card catalog in a library),
to the contents of journals or periodicals (for example, the Reader's Guide
to Periodical Literature), to collections of facts (for example, a telephone
directory), or to numeric data (such as physical constants of a group
of compounds or numeric data collected in a questionnaire study).

Bibliographic Coupling  Extended in Time: Ten Case Histories
.A
Kessler, M.M.
.W
   The methods of bibliographic coupling were applied to 8186 papers in thirty-
five volumes of the Physical Review (Vol. 77, 1950 to Vol. 111, 1958).. The 
results are reported in the form of ten case histories.. Each case was chosen 
to illustrate a problem in information retrieval..

A Methodology for Test and Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Goffman, W.
Newill, V.A.
.W
  A recognition of the importance of useful evaluative techniques is an 
indirect or secondary result of the hugely expanded national investment in 
scientific research.  Such recognition has followed the expenditure of much time
and money on the development of information systems which utilize advances in
information handling and data processing (primarily computer-oriented) to
handle the "explosion" of recorded information.  Information scientists from
a typically diverse group of parent disciplines are now cooperating not only
to develop methodologies of evaluation of such systems, but to apply them.

Factors Affecting the Preferences of Industrial Personnel for Information
  Gathering Methods
.A
Rosenberg, Victor
.W
   A structured questionnaire was administered to professional personnel in 
industrial and government organizations, asking the subjects to rank eight 
information gathering methods according to their preference in given
hypothetical situation.. The subjects were then asked to rate the methods on a
seven point scale according to (a) ease of use and (b) amount of information 
expected.. The subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time
spent in research or research related activities.. The groups were designated
"research" and "nonresearch"..
   A statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects (52 in research, 44 in
nonresearch) showed that no statistically significant differences were present 
in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel.. 
   The results of the study infer that the ease of use of an information
gathering method is more important than the amount of information expected for
information gathering methods in industrial and government, regardless of the 
research orientation of the users..

On the Articulation of Surrogates:  An Attempt at an Epistemological
Foundation
.A
Perreault, J.M.
.W
  There are two major purposes, in mind, for this gathering.  The first is the
most general that can be proposed for any gathering: the simple advantage of
bringing together those who have been at work on a single problem or at least
a small class of problems - especially when this problem has not previously
benefited from exclusive and thematic collaboration among its investigators.
To further such thematic collaboration, the formal presentations have been
scheduled no more than three each day, with time left after each presentation
for (formal) discussion here in the conference room, and with as much time as
possible - given the number of presentations - left free for informal 
discussion. 
  The second purpose is one of even greater necessity, in my opinion, though
one not so obvious as the first.  Over and above the hope for interchange of
what has already been thought out - in the form of personal contact, where
the presence of the originator of the system or theory can reinforce the
printed word in its usual and ineffable way - it is my hope that we will all
be able (especially in our informal discussions) to penetrate beyond mere
similarity and difference to the underlying philosophical bases of syntactic
relationship.

Some Remarks on Information Languages, Their Analysis and Comparison
.A
Soergel, D.
.W
    "The machine language [information language in our terminology D.S.]
should not be confused with the machine code: (Upenskii, 59:357).  In
Ranganathan's more general terms: There should be no confusion between the
idea plane and the notational plane.  Many difficulties in classification
arise from this confusion.  This paper is devoted mainly to problems on
the idea plane.
    "The IR-language I want to talk about, is the language in which the
information to be retrieved is formulated, i.e. a declarative sentence
language, not the imperative sentence language of the programmer-retriever"
(Bohnert in Samet, 62.1:10), that is, the information language should not
be confused with the programming language.  (To avoid misunderstandings
it would perhaps be better to say "descriptive" instead of "declarative"
and to state explicitly that in a descriptive sentence an imperative may
be described which is, however, not to be executed by the system but to
be retrieved by appropriate searches.)

Concept Organization for Information Retrieval
.A
Farradane, J.
.W
  All analysis of information for storage and of questions for effecting
retrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them.
The concepts may be just words (descriptors), as in simple post-co-ordinate
keyword indexing systems, or they may be class-terms or other idea-groupings,
as in classifications.  The relations between concepts often appear to be
absent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is
clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or
questioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead to
false drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organization
of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed
in the form of groupings called classes.

Automatic Term Classifications and Retrieval
.A
Sparck-Jones, K.
Needham, R. M.
.W
   Recent research at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has been concerned 
with the application of the automatic classification techniques associated with 
the "theory of clumps" to document description obtained from the Aslib-Cranfield
project, and with the use of the resulting term classifications in retrieval..
A substantial program engine has been developed which computes similarities 
between pairs of terms on the basis of their occurrences and co-occurrences in 
document descriptions, and finds classes of terms with strong similarity 
connections by minimizing the cohesion between a potential clump and its 
complement; and which retrieves using single terms and/or term classes 
according to specification, and calculates recall and precision ratios for sets 
of requests.. Serious tests with different similarity and clump definitions and 
with different modes of using term classes are still in progress, so on 
definite conclusions about the value of this kind of classification are 
presented..

Some Structural Characteristics of Articulated Subject Indexes
.A
Armitage, Janet E.
Lynch, Michael F.
.W
   An articulated subject index is one in which logical transformations of 
natural language phrases containing prepositions or connectives are employed to 
organize the noun phrases as subject headings, with subordinate displays of the 
remainder of the phrases.. The best-known example of the articulated subject 
index is that to Chemical Abstracts..
   It has been shown that a well-defined transformation links the entry, as it 
appears in the index, with the original phrase, in natural order, as it was 
first compiled by the indexer.. A reverse transformation can be used to 
generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more 
prepositions or connectives..
   A simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject 
index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives
or words acting as gerunds or participles.. A sorting algorithm has also been 
developed, the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to 
greatest organization in the index display..
   Deviations from the model in manually-produced indexes are described.. The 
potential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval 
is examined..

Integrated Information Processing and the Case for a National Network
.A
Dammers, H. F.
.W
   The various premises, which need consideration when developing a realistic 
and flexible information storage, retrieval and dissemination (ISRD) system, 
are discussed; their implication is illustrated with some examples from the 
development of the system at "Shell" Research, Sittingbourne..
   One of the factors which will affect the satisfactory performance of an ISRD
system is the ease with which relevant literature information not held in the 
system can be provided..
   The later part of the paper is developed to a discussion of this problem and
of a possible means of dealing with it in the not too distant future..

Some Experiments in the Selective Dissemination of Information
  in the Field of Plasma Physics
.A
Anthony, L. J.
Cheney, A. G.
Whelan, E.K.
.W
   A small-scale, computer-based SDI system in plasma physics and the related 
subjects is described briefly.. The system serves about 100 research scientists 
and engineers and uses title input only in order to minimize input costs.. The
implications of this approach and its effect upon the system parameters is
discussed.. Some comparison of the costs of the computer-based system with 
those of a manual system is made..
   Further experiments are described in which the service is expanded to 
external users on a world-wide basis, the aim being to compare, under controlled
conditions, the parameters of the small-scale internal service with those of an 
external service on a wide scale..
   The paper concludes with some observations on the future development and 
organization of computer-assisted services, their possibilities and the main 
problems which are likely to arise..

Performance of Automatic Information Systems
.A
Lesk, Michael E.
.W
   The SMART document retrieval system is used to investigate algorithms for
text analysis and request searching.. Results from three document collections 
indicate that word normalization is efficiently performed by automatic thesaurus
lookup, while phrase matching procedures, statistical association methods, and 
concept hierarchies are useful for special applications.. Automatic document 
clustering schemes and use-interactive feedback methods permit rapid searches of
large collections.. Abstracts are found to be superior to titles as a base for
content analysis in a document retrieval system and almost as good as complete
texts.. Proper procedures for designing dictionaries and searching requests
are discussed..The practicality of large scale document centers and their proper
design are considered in light of these results..

Negotiation of Inquiries in an On-Line Retrieval System
.A
Hillman, Donald J.
.W
The focus of discussion is a prototype retrieval system with three major 
components for text processing, connectivity and decision operations.. Each of
these components is based on a distinguishable subtheory..
   Computer programs for the first two components have been written for a GE 
225 computer.. The complete prototype system is now being programmed for 
operation in a time-shared environment.. It is a user-oriented system, with 
planned capabilities for the browsing and man-machine interaction..
A major goal is to develop procedures whereby research workers can conduct an 
on-line dialog via terminals with a body of scientific information.. Each 
user-submitted inquiry is a set of sentences without restriction as to 
vocabulary or form.. The system converses with the user to obtain 
source-derived phrases that elaborate and refine the initial inquiry.. The use is
led to browse in the general area of his inquiry and to broaden or narrow it as
a further aid to request formulation..
   Evaluation of system performance is described..

Relevance Assessments and Retrieval System Evaluation
.A
Lesk, M. E.
Salton, G.
.W
   Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information 
retrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since the 
determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents 
which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that
query, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally valid 
evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures..
   A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance 
assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure 
retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information 
science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the 
relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall 
and precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision 
data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many 
distinct user classes..

An Indirect Method of Information Retrieval
.A
Goffman, William
.W
   The information retrieval process, treated strictly as a matching procedure,
has the defects that tha whole file must be probed for each query, and that it
overlooks the fact that the relevance of the information from one document 
depends upon what is already known about the subject, and in term affects the 
relevance of other documents subsequently examined.. A mathematical model of a 
search technique in which the defects of the direct method are taken into account 
is demonstrated by an experiment in which a given paper is treated as an enquiry
and the references cited in the paper are treated as relevant answers.. The
results in two tests show much better results than those achieved by the direct 
method.. No spurious material was retrieved by either method..

The Use of Automatically-Obtained Keyword Classifications 
   for Information Retrieval
.A
Jones, K. Sparck
Jackson, D. M.
.W
   This report summarizes the work carried out on the automatic construction of
keyword classifications and their use in information retrieval that we have 
carried out in the last eighteen months.. It discusses the possible 
characteristics of such classifications, and potential ways of using them; and 
described the various approaches to classification we have considered, in terms
of an overall frame of reference in which several types of classification are 
distinguished.. The results of experiments using a collection of documents and
test requests obtained from the Aslib Clanfield project are presented, from 
which it can be conclude that automatic classifications which lead to noticeable
improvements in retrieval performance over those obtainable with unclassified 
terms can be set up..

Experiments in Book Indexing by Computer
.A
Borko, Harold
.W
   The most challenging task in preparing an index to a book is to select all 
and only those terms that are related to the text and are useful for relevance 
purposes.. While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive 
basis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining 
and selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection are 
proposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and 
exclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of
"good index terms", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms
for their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the 
principle of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not 
achieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms..
Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could 
successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by 
the experimenter.. A comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using 
machine-aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques..

Computer Use in Information and Data Handling: 
  an Appraisal of Its Economic Aspects
.A
Dammers, H. F.
.W
   The economic merits of applying computers in information storage, retrieval 
and dissemination have usually been considered with respect only to the cost of 
operating the information services concerned.. This had tended to indicate that
computer use is economically justified mainly for housekeeping operations in 
the large scale organizations..
   The present paper takes a wider view and included in its appraisal the costs
involved in information gathering and dissemination for the total system 
representing the information services and its users.. It is suggested that the 
inclusion of cost elements associated with user time devoted to information 
gathering tends to shift the economic appraisal in favor of computer application
in information work..
   In fact, such computer use appears to find its main stimulus and economic 
justification    in an environment that provides strong incentives to minimize 
the total cost of the system whilst maximizing its benefits to the users..
   To illustrate this some example are given based on experience gained in 
research data handling and the operation of SDI services in an industrial 
research establishment..

Performance and Cost of "Free-Text" Search systems
.A
Kent, A.K.
.W
  The purpose of an information-retrieval system is to provide the user with
citations relevant to his query.  Since the user is the only person competent
to make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the
selection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval
error.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures
of performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of the
system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure
to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It is
difficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in
being provided with irrelevant citations.  From the user's point of view,
therefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is a
deficient system.

Experimental Use of a Program for Computer-Aided Subject-Index Production
.A
Armitage, J.E.
Lynch, M. F.
Petrie, J. H.
Belton, M.
.W
   Stages in the development of a program for the production of articulated 
subject indexes are described.. The preparation of an index to the third 
edition of the SMRE Bibliography has enabled the technique to be assessed in a 
practical situation.. Titles from 1700 documents included in the bibliography 
were edited to provide input to the program, and the output recorded on a 
micro-film/hard-copy recorder in upper case alone..
   Further developments now in hand are indicated and criteria for assessing the 
suitability of the technique relative to other index-production techniques are 
discussed..

Optimum Procedures for Economic Information Retrieval
.A
Heaps, H. S.
Thiel, L. H.
.W
   Computer searches on Chemical Titles tapes for current awareness at the 
University of Alberta since May, 1968, have provided sufficient data to allow 
formulation of a cost function based on the number of titles searched, the 
length of questions, the extent to which questions may be batched, and certain 
details regarding the allowed forms of question.. With different choice of 
parameters the cost function could be adapted to apply to searches of other data 
bases..
   An attempt to make retrospective searching economically feasible has led to
formulation of different search techniques.. It is suggested that the search 
procedure should be designed to minimize computation time at the expense of 
convenience in the form of output, but that facilities should be included so 
that the user who is willing to play the additional cost may receive output in 
a more convenient form..
   In recognition of the fact that the form of search question should be 
dependent on the vocabulary of the data base, a program has been developed to 
modify a question so that it is optimal for searches on the given data base..

The Cost and Costing of Information Storage and Retrieval 
.A
Sessions, V.S.
.W
  This presentation on economic aspects of information retrieval is based
on data gathered by Project URBANDOC during the course of four years in
developing documentation services for the literature of urban planning
and renewal.  It was a substantial effort - half a million dollars is
no small sum in the social sciences - made possible by an Urban Renewal
Demonstration Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) to The City University of New York.  The proposal that initiated the
Project in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographic
services in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarians
were looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems.
URBANDOC was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body of
literature which had been neglected by the information science community before
the advent of computerization, and completely by-passed by it afterwards.

grew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishments
to have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological
information.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the
field of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is
acute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two
systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other
policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social 
development.
  An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be
described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical 
operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these
figures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation,
file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other
than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system
may have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted
information systems may make sense within individual institutional
environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking
various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate
more efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line
networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility
of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.

   This paper reports the results of a practical study of the application of 
digital computers to the storage, analysis and retrieval of the full text of 
Acts of Parliament and associated delegated legislation dealing with automatic 
energy, a total of some 140,000 words.. A suite of computer programs has been 
prepared in a high-level language for generating a dictionary and concordance 
to the full text and organizing the search process.. The interrogation 
language QUEST is described and its application to full text searching 
discussed..

Experiments in Automatic Extracting and Indexing
.A
Earl, Lois L.
.W
   This article reports on several experiments in automatic extracting and one
experiment in automating indexing.. Nine chapters, each from a different 
technical book, were used as a text corpus for all the experiments.. In the 
first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of 
syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it 
proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typing
might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting 
techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria 
in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding.. 
The sentences selected  by the extracting algorithm  were representative and 
are presented for the reader to peruse.. The noun phrases selected by the 
indexing algorithm compared favorably with the back-of-the-book index phrases..
There is every indication that satisfactory back-of-the-book indexes could be 
produced automatically, with post-editing to delete superfluous items..

Cost-Effectiveness as a Guide in Developing Indexing Rules
.A
Schultz, Claire K.
.W
   To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the 
course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, 
been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some 
objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type 
criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the 
state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate 
for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that 
takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of 
operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing 
possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of 
effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, 
machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of 
criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach
is described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of 
effectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to
reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of 
defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete 
steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and 
small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..

Compilation of Thesauri for Use in Computer Systems
.A
Rolling, L.N.
.W
  A thesaurus can be defined as a structured vocabulary for use in information
storage and retrieval systems.
  Three parts of this definition need further elaboration:
  1. A vocabulary is a collection of terms.
  2. The structure of a vocabulary can be described as a set of relationships
     between terms.
  3. Utilization of a thesaurus in an information system involves a set of
     rules which take into account the characteristics of the system.

Information-Seeking Behavior of Catalog Users
.A
Tagliacozzo, R.
Kochen, M.
.W
   This study is based on the data from a survey of catalog use at three 
university libraries and one public library.. Both "known-item" searches and
"subject" searches were analyzed.. The characteristics of the user population 
were examined and methodological problems of the survey were discussed.. A
relation was found between the academic rank of the catalog users and type of 
search that they carry out.. Some of the factors influencing the success or 
failure of the search were analyzed, and the meaning of "success" for the two
types of search was discussed.. The study investigated tends in search 
strategies as well as degree of perseverance of catalog searchers..Implications 
for the design of modern information retrieval systems were pointed out..

Automatic Classification and Retrieval of Documents by Means 
  of a Bibliographic Pattern Discovery Algorithm
.A
Schiminovich, S.
.W
   We present completely automatic procedures for the self-generation of 
meaningful groups among the members of a document collection and for the 
classification according to these groups of subsequent documents.. These
procedures operate on large document collections with reasonably short
computation times.. Thus far, in our experiments on the physics literature,
automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manual
indexing and, in addition, potentially less expensive.. Empirically derived, 
our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only the 
citation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic links 
among papers.. The self-generated groups correspond to very specific subject 
headings; retrospective bibliographies generated in the procedures allow one 
to classify the subsequent literature with remarkably high recall and 
relevance ratios, close to 100%..

Columbia University School of Library Service System 
  for Thesaurus Development and Maintenance
.A
Hines, T. C.
Harris, Jessica L.
.W
   A system for computer-based thesaurus production and maintenance has been 
developed at Columbia University School of Library Service.. The system is
highly flexible, providing for all the types of data elements which have been 
used in both thesauri and subject heading lists, with additional features found
to be useful as a result of the ongoing research program at Columbia.. Three
thesauri in widely varying subject fields are in the final stages of production
under the system.. As a result of the simultaneous development of the thesauri 
(based on actual indexing universes) and of the production system, which is 
part of a larger program of research in information handling problems, a variety
of new techniques and procedures have been developed as their usefulness became 
evident..

Five Years, Five Volumes and 2345 Pages 
  of the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Saracevic, Tefko
.W
   The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST) is now 5
years old.. In these 5 years ARIST became not only a very much used and quoted 
tool, but also an established institution.. This is testified by the fact that 
each of the five volumes was the year's most frequently and most comprehensively
reviewed book in the field.. The ARIST effort is unparalleled in great many 
fields..
   Currently we are entering an era of intense concern about and reactions to
science and technology.. All sciences and technologies are subject to 
questioning, scrutiny and evaluation both inside and outside of their subject 
areas..
   Scrutiny of a field may be attempted by a scrutiny of its important 
literature items.. With 5 years and five volumes ARIST invites and affords a 
perspective.. This review is attempting in broad brushstrokes to be a critical 
examination of the underlying structure, and literature base as well as the 
achievements of the ARIST effort as a whole..

A Technique for the Evaluation of a Commercial Information Service and Some
Preliminary Results from the Drugdoc Service of the 
Excerpta Medica Foundation
.A
Scott, E. J.
Townley, H. M.
Stern, B. T.
.W
   The selectivity, timeliness and quality of indexing of a commercial service 
may be assessed by comparing the journal articles chosen by an organization as 
relevant to its interests, with those subsequently reported by the service..
These aspects were evaluated with respect to Drugdoc which scans over 3400
biomedical journals.. The results showed that the selection criteria laid down 
by Drugdoc are strictly adhered to; the mean time of alerting of an article 
was 11-3 weeks after receipt of the journal at Wellcome and all articles from a
particular journal issue were reported by Drugdoc on average within 13-6 
weeks.. Indexing was examined in detail and on average 8-1 primary 
thesaurus-controlled indexing terms were assigned per article.. Pilot studies
were also run on SDI profiles compiled from the Drugdoc Thesaurus..

A Multidisciplinary and Computerized SDI Service for Industry and 
Research-Practical Experience and Costs
.A
Hisinger, B.
.W
   In this paper the experiences, costs, price policy, market, sales promotion
and foreign cooperation of a Danish documentation department are described in
relation to two databases, as follows: The COMPENDEX tapes are scanned in
Denmark, whereas the INSPEC tapes are scanned in Holland with the inclusion of
Danish profiles according to a bilateral agreement.. The total costs in 
connection with COMPENDEX are evaluated and divided into four main components:
Disbursement to the supplier of the tape system, working expenses of the 
documentation center, costs of the electronic data processing, and expenses
connected with the procurement of the original material to the subscribers..
They can choose between including or deleting the COMPENDEX abstracts during
sequential text scanning and printing-out.. Search profiles are formed by the 
terms (word, author, journal code) connected by AND/OR/NOT-logic and weight
factors.. (The above documentation department belongs to the National 
Technological Library of Denmark and also two SDI services based on tape 
systems from CAS.. Retrospective searches have been carried out)..

Interactive Reference Retrieval in Large Files
.A
Carville, M.
Higgins, L. D.
Smith, Francis J.
.W
   We express the conviction that on-line reference retrieval will largely 
replace the present tape driven system in a few years.. We describe the design
criteria of such an on-line system based on our experience of a pilot system 
which has been operational for 2 years, emphasizing the importance of
minimizing the number of disk accesses.. We recommend the use of hash coding 
for searching in a thesaurus and point out that the user of an on-line system 
should use the most precise terms first and the common terms last - the 
opposite of the procedure in a manual search..

The Use of Hierarchic Clustering in Information Retrieval
.A
Jardine, N.
Van Rijsbergen, C. J.
.W
   We introduce information retrieval strategies which are based on automatic
hierarchic clustering of documents.. We discuss the evaluation of retrieval
strategies and show, using a subset of the Cranfield Aeronautics document 
collection, that cluster-based retrieval strategies can be devised which are as 
effective as linear associative retrieval strategies and much more efficient..
Finally, we outline how cluster-based retrieval may be extended to large growing
document collections and indicate some ways in which the effectiveness of
cluster-based retrieval strategies may be improved..

Retrieval Efficiency from Titles and the Cost of Indexing
.A
Tell, Bjorn V.
.W
   By the means of the flexible machine search system three experiments have 
been made in order to test the retrieval efficiency of searching free text and 
keywords.. Base upon the relevance judgements of the users, the results 
indicate that titles and abstracts are good index material which can be used 
for machine searching without human indexing in the three fields studies..

Program Design for Retrospective Searches on Large Data Bases
.A
Thiel, L. H.
Heaps, H. S.
.W
   Retrospective search of large document data bases requires development of 
special techniques for automatic compression of data and minimization of the 
number of input-output operations to the computer accessible files.. Also, the 
computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of 
internal memory..
   The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that 
meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically 
expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural 
spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for
extensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted
index greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long
strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage..
Creation of "reduced" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it
allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed 
to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..

Experiences of IIT Research Institute in Operating a Computerized Retrieval
System for Searching a Variety of Data Bases
.A
Williams, Martha E.
.W
   The Computer Search Center (CSC) at IIT Research Institute (IITRI) provides
information from computer-readable data bases to users in industry, government
and universities.. The center was designed to meet user needs by providing a 
variety of services from multiple data bases with minimal restrictions and a
high degree of flexibility.. A new modular machine-independent PL/1 software
system was developed for handling virtually any bibliographic-type base.. CSC
have run at nine different computer facilities with different: hardware,
computer models, versions of OS, peripherals of the PL/1 compiler.. All data
bases are converted by preprocessors to a standard IITRI format which employs
a directory and character string type of the structure..
   User oriented profile features include: full free form Boolean logic with 
any degree of nesting; search terms may be any data element on a data base; 
search terms may be single words, multi-word terms, phrases, or term fragments;
full truncation capabilities; optional sort of author, citation number, or 
weight; and optional printing of output on 5x8 cards, multilith masters, paper,
or tape.. User aids were developed for each data base to assist in profile and
monitoring.. They include: search manuals, truncation guides, term frequency 
list and KLIC indexes..
   Research is conducted and statistics maintained to study, monitor, and 
improve Center components including data bases, user satisfaction, systems,
personnel functions and services.. The many advantages of computerized 
retrieval, which are the raison d'etre for the center, include: coverage,
thoroughness, consistency, interdisciplinariness, recall, speed, regularity,
file preparation and cost effectiveness..

Communication and Information Processing within Scientific Disciplines:
Empirical Findings for Psychology
.A
Garvey, William D.
Griffith, Belver C.
.W
   Scientific disciplines can be regarded as social devices which have, as one
function, the analysis and reduction of raw information to assimilated 
knowledge of a type which can be transmitted through professional training..
Data on information flow in psychology reveal feedback to scientific workers
and result in refinements of the product of research; later disseminations are 
interwoven with processes of evaluation and selection and are directed toward 
the creation of an integrated and tested body of knowledge.. The reported data 
finish an empirical base for Ziman's consensual model of science and illuminate 
difficulties which have arisen in the design and implementation of information 
systems..

Evaluating the Effectiveness of an On-Line, 
Natural Language Retrieval System
.A
Lancaster, F. W.
Rapport, Rochard L.
Penry, J. Fiffin
.W
   An evaluation of an on-line retrieval system known as EARS (Epilepsy 
Abstracts Retrieval System) has been performed.. The system, which permits the 
free text searching of approximately 8000 abstracts drawn from Epilepsy 
Abstracts, is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and 
Stroke (NINDS).. Specialists in the field of neurology, at six medical centers
in the United States, conducted on-line searches to satisfy their own needs for 
information.. Parallel searches were conducted on the same search topics by a 
neurologist at NINDS who was highly experienced in using the system.. The 
results of the original searches were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, 
and general user satisfaction.. A detailed analysis of factors affecting  the
success and failure of the on_line searches was carried out..

A Journal Selection Model and Its Implications for a Library System
.A
Kraft, D. H.
Hill, T. W. Jr.
.W
   The problem of selecting which journals to acquire in order to best satisfy 
library objectives is modeled as a zero-one linear programming problem and 
examined in detail.. The model incorporates an objective function based on 
expected usage as a measure of journal worth and cost constraints which 
account for the scarcity of capital.. The model can be used to aid the 
librarian in making better selection decisions, since the objective function 
can be shown to reflect the evaluation of the library as an information 
retrieval system and as a service organization.. Moreover, the model of seen to 
be related to inventory problems and scheduling models in industrial 
operations.. 
   Journal usage is discussed as a measure of journal worth and is contrasted 
to journal productivity.. Constraints are considered for scarce resources other 
than capital and for journal interrelationships..

Problems in Information Retrieval: 
 Logical Jumps in the Expression of Information
.A
Farradane, J.
Russel, J. M.
Yates-Mercer, P. A.
.W
   In a structured data base, such as that obtained when information is indexed
in a format including explicit relations, retrieval of all relevant items in
response to a question may, in some cases, be restricted by technicalities of 
the structure.. Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of 
a concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two 
interstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in 
order to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposed
which could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored 
information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form 
of linear or string display.. Nine rules are proposed for condensation of 
angular structures.. Other type of logical jump and abbreviation are discussed, 
together with related studies of expansions and inference steps..

Machine_Aided Indexing of Technical Literature
.A
Klingbiel, Paul H.
.W
   To index successfully in the Defense Documentation Center's environment, an
automated system must chose single words or phrases (dependent upon context)
rapidly and economically.. The automation of DDC's indexing has been 
machine-aided from its inception.. A machine-aided indexing (MAI) system is 
described that indexes one million words of text per hour of CPU time.. 
Grammatical errors do not exceed five per cent of the output, so human 
screening is satisfactorily low.. The system could potentially scale up to an
operational size of 10 million words of text per year - the equivalent of a
dozen bibles or a third of the Encyclopedia Britannica.. In a batch mode, the
programs to accomplish this indexing would require no more than fifteen minutes
of CPU time per week..

A Bayesian Approach to Interactive Retrieval
.A
Tague, Jean M.
.W
   This paper presents a probabilistic model for interactive retrieval.. 
Specifically, it applies the principles of Bayesian statistical decision theory:
(1) the use of both prior (subjective) and sample information about the
relationship of document descriptions to query relevance, and (2) maximization 
of the expected value of a utility function, to the problem of optimally 
restructuring a search strategy in an interactive environment..

Distance between Sets as an Objective Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness
.A
Heine, M. H.
.W
   A general measure of retrieval effectiveness having full metric properties 
and treating the "retrieval system - arbiter of relevance"situation 
symmetrically, is the Marczewski-Steinhaus metric, D, measuring the distance 
between the set of relevant documents, A, and set of retrieved documents, B, 
according to D = 1 -(n (A ^ B)/n(A u B)).. D can be expressed as a function of 
Presicion and Recall, or of Generality, Fallout and Recall, and of other sets 
of traditional measures.. Acceptance of the measure allows criteria for 
retrieval optimality and degeneracy to be stated, defined by minimum and 
constant  values of D respectively.. Precision_Recall degeneracy curves for D 
are given and compared with those for another general measure: the probability
that a document will be correctly identified by a retrieval system.. 
Statistical extensions of D are examined, and these and other properties of the
metric are illustrated with seven examples..

CA Condensates as a Retrospective Search Tool	A Commentary
.A
Hansen, Inge Berg
.W
   A retrospective test search on 1 year of CA Condensates was carried out in 
order to calculate the cost per profile and to get an impression of how CA 
Condensates would suffice as a database for a retrospective use.. Some means of
improving the search strategy by means of the CAS Standard Distribution Format
were investigated.. The question is raised whether the costs and efforts 
presently devoted to research regarding retrospective searches on large 
free-text databases are justified in view of the low average precision ratios 
generally observed for free text databases and the very high number of 
references of potential interest retrieved..

Compression of Bibliographic Files Using an Adaptation of Run-Length Coding
.A
Lynch, Michael F.
.W
   Substantial degrees of compression of bibliographical data bases result from
the application to them a modified form of run-length coding.. The method
involves attenuation of the zero:one bit ratio of the data base.. This can be 
achieved by substitution of codes with the highest zero:one ratios the most
frequent symbols, or by substitution of 2-bytes codes for diagrams.. A form of
run-length coding in which the run-length is represented as a fixed-length
binary number is then applied..

Automatic Indexing and Generation of Classification Systems by Algorithm
.A
Hoyle, W. G.
.W
   A system of automatic indexing based on Baye's theorem is described 
briefly.. In assigning 124 documents to 9 categories, there were 97 cases of 
agreement with professional indexers.. Using a collection factor, based on 87 
per cent human consistency from other courses, the computer appears then to 
index with 90 per cent accuracy in this case..
   The technique is then used with two randomized sample document groups drawn
from nine categories.. Each group in turn is used as the basis for indexing the
other.. The computer knows only the number of categories.. After 8 cycles the 
computer is found to have formed 9 groups consisting of about 50 per cent of 
documents that were also lumped together by professional indexers on the basis 
of subject content..
   A new measure of performance is proposed and some other applications of the 
technique indicated..

The Cost_Performance of an On-Line, Free-Text Bibliographic Retrieval System
.A
Katzer, Jeffrey
.W
   The cost-performance evaluation of the SUPARS system is reported.. SUPARS 
was an on-line, free-text bibliographic  retrieval system; cost-effectiveness 
data of such systems are not readily available.. In our evaluation, two 
measures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in 
dollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be 
expended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an 
estimate of the recall ratio..
   To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which 
experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries
from written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the 
list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information
problems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each 
of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted 
below..
   (1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) have
better cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant 
searching operators..
   (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to
improving the cost-performance of the system..
   (3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences among
users of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operation 
and evaluation of retrieval systems.. It appears that consideration of these 
factors will improve system cost-performance..

Analysis of the Microstructure of Titles in the INSPEC Data-Base
.A
Lynch, Michael F.
Petrie, J. Howard
Snell, Michael J.
.W
   A high degree of constancy has been found to exist in the microstructure of 
titles of samples of the INSPEC data-base taken over 3-year period.. Character
and diagram frequencies are shown to be relatively stable, while variable-length
character-string characterizing samples separated by 3 years in time show close
similarities..

On the Role of Subjectivity in Establishing, Using, Operating and Evaluating
Information Retrieval Systems
Treatise II on Retrieval System Theory
.A
Fugman, Robert
.W
   The personal literature search of a scientist is strongly governed by
subjective influences.. If he delegates his literature search he should always 
be aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. This
prevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search,
particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him conscious
of the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot 
dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. He
will also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods needed
for operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the 
methods sufficient for his personal file..
   The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, 
operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival 
power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of
fundamental notions such as "information" and "order".. This gives him a better
understanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently,
even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in 
storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to 
make such operations more "objective" and formal.. Such a better mutual
understanding will be bound to promote advance in methodology and psychology of 
scientific communication..

On-Line Information retrieval as a Scientists Tool
.A
Barber, Stephanie A.
Barraclough, Elizabeth D.
Gray, W. Alexander
.W
   The use of an on-line information retrieval system by the scientists 
themselves is described.. MEDUSA was designed to allow physicians to 
interrogate the MEDLARS data base.. A brief description is given of the system 
and details of an experiment to test its effectiveness.. Search formulation 
prepared on-line by medical research workers are compared for recall and 
precision with the same requests formulated by search editors in the normal 
way.. The results show that physicians can use an on-line system effectively..

A Technique for Machine-Aided Indexing
.A
Klingbiel, Paul H.
.W
   Subject indexing of text can, in principle, be accomplished in many ways.. 
The technique for machine-aided indexing (MAI) developed at the Defense 
Documentation Center (DDC) is illustrated on a randomly chosen abstract..
Additional text is provided in coded form so that the reader can more fully
explore this technique and form his own opinion of the applicability and 
versatility of this particular procedure.. The DDC method for subject indexing 
is very close to operational status for a data base which grows at the rate of 
two million words of text per year..

Customized User Services via Interactions with LEADERMART
.A
Hillman, Donald J.
.W
   LEADERMART is a fully operational information retrieval system featuring 
on-line interactive service  to a wide variety of user groups in business,
industry, government, and universities.. With the availability of many
computer-readable bibliographic data bases, experience with users dictated the 
development of special-purpose information products based on a thorough 
understanding of individual client needs, and the delivery of such products in 
a customized form.. Each different application required a different package, 
with variations of both software and data base coverage.. These packages were
developed via suitable modification of modular system software to result in 
products tailored to user idiosyncracies..
   The paper describes problems associated with these repackaging procedures, 
and discusses the changes brought about by the introduction of an on-line, 
interactive retrieval service into the operating environment of users.. 
Implications for networking and resource-sharing, focusing upon 
cost-effectiveness and performance measures, are also discussed..

A Remote-Terminal Retrospective Search Facility Using a Hybrid of Microform
and Computer Storage
.A
Irvine, J. J.
.W
   This paper describes a technical document center providing remote-terminal
retrospective search capability and shows its evolution from the traditional 
catalog card operation..
   The system uses mini-computers for on-line input and editing of data and for
production of announcements, and uses a commercial computer-utility/
communication network for retrospective searching.. A hybrid of microform and 
computer storage was designed to decrease computer and line charges and to allow
for security considerations..
   Bilingual search capability in either of two models suitable for experienced
users or novices is provided to a network of satellite libraries separated by 
as much as 3000 miles..
   A Selective Dissemination of Information service is provided using in-house 
and foreign data bases and serving over 600 profiles of interest..

Indexing Language Structure for Automated Retrieval
.A
Wall, R. A.
.W
   A proposal for a computer-aided method of building up an indexing language 
is made.. The method involves linking the terms relevant to any special 
retrieval system into the UDC, preferably in the form of the Standard Reference
Code when it becomes available.. Links between the terms are intended to be 
established in such a way that, provided indexing input sessions are 
accomplished via a video terminal, a hybrid thesaurus-classification could be 
built up by a form of "learning process" in the course of regular indexing.. 
The proposed means of establishing links between terms are described, the
associated computer system is outlined, and an example of indexing language
built-up procedure is presented.. Possible uses for natural language search, 
using the thesaurus-classification as a "switching language", and for automatic
classification, are suggested as long-term aims..

Index Term Weighting
.A
Jones, Karen Sparck
.W
   Various approaches to index term weighting have been investigated.. In
particular, claims have been made for the value of statistically-based
indexing in automatic retrieval systems.. The paper discusses the logic of 
different types of weighting, and describes experiments testing weighting 
schemes of these types.. The result show that one type of weighting leads to
material performance improvements in quite different collection environments..

Relevance, Pertinence and Information System Development
.A
Kemp, D.A.
.W
   The different between pertinence and relevance is discussed.. Other pairs of
terms and the differences between their members are examined, and the 
suggestion is made that such studies could increase our understanding of the 
theory of information systems, and hence lead to practical improvements.. Some
examples are considered, among them the use of "personality profiles" to 
improve the pertinence effectiveness of systems..

The Dynamic Scientific-Information User
.A
Garvey, William D.
Tomita, Kazuo
Woolf, Patricia
.W
   In this article we examine the concept of the "information user", and 
attempt to describe some of the dynamics of the situation by discussing some of
our data relative to "intraindividual variations" (changes which occur within
individual scientists as their scientific work progresses) and "interindividual
variations" (physical vs social scientists, basic vs applied scientists, 
experienced vs inexperienced scientists, and scientists' working in the same
subject-matter area vs scientists who recently changed their areas).. All of
these were found to produce significant variation in the information needs of 
scientists and in the sources they used to satisfy these needs.. Some 
implications of these findings relative to information technology are 
discussed..

Reintjes, J. Francis
.W
   A comprehensive review of the experimental information storage and retrieval 
system developed by Project Intrex is presented, together with a description of
major results and conclusions that were derived through use of the system.. 
Salient features of the Intrex system included an argumented catalog stored in
an online interactive computer in combination with full-text storage on 
microfiche.. Guaranteed access to full text at remote allocations was provided
through use of an automatic fiche storage and retrieval system that was
computer-controlled.. Discussed in the paper are the details of the catalog 
structure, user experiments, economic studies and information-system 
networking..

Information Theory and Reliable Communication
.A
Gallagher, R.G.
.W
  This book is designed primarily for use as a first-year graduate text in
information theory, suitable for both engineers and mathematicians.  It is
assumed that the reader has some understanding of freshman calculus and
elementary probability, and in the later chapters some introductory random
process theory.  Unfortunately there is one more requirement that is harder
to meet.  The reader must have a reasonable level of mathematical maturity
and capability for abstract thought.  The major results of the theory are
quite subtle and abstract and must sometimes be arrived at by what appears to
be rather devious routes.  Fortunately, recent simplifications in the theory
have made the major results more accessible than in the past.

Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.B
1972
.W
  This book is concerned primarily with those "intellectual" factors that
significantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems;
namely,
    - indexing policy and practice
    - vocabulary control
    - searching control
    - interaction between the system and its users
    My viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems.  I have
therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements
of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance
in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements.
    The book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with equipment
for the implementation of retrieval systems, a topic that is adequately
covered by other volumes in this series.  Moreover, it is my contention that
the importance of "hardware" and "data processing" aspects of information
systems has been exaggerated in the United States, with some detriment
to the performance of many systems.

A universal scheme served as the basis for classifying information retrieval
languages.
The book analyses in detail universal scheme similarities and differences
between natural and information retrieval languages; some ways of constructing
information retrieval language are discussed.

ISBD(S) and Title Main Entry for Serials
.A
Spalding, C. Sumner
.W
  At the IFLA Liverpool Conference in 1971 a Joint working
Group of the Committees on Cataloguing and on Serial Publications
was set up to draw up an International Standard Bibliographic
Description for Serials, taking the ISBD(M) as a model in
so far as practicable.  As might be expected, the special problems
presented by serial publications made the task of developing an
ISBD(S) a difficult assignment which the Joint Working Group
tackled with great energy and devotion.  The successive drafts
were prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L.
Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier.
  Probably no data element presented such a severe problem as
that of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen,
Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy's, and the like seemed to 
demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  A
solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device
which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic
title proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen-
space and dubbing the happy couple the "distinctive title."

(Towards a Theory of the Concept)
.A
Dahlberg, I.
.W
  A concept is regarded as the common element of
both classification systems and thesauri.  Reality
and knowledge are not represented by words or
terms but by the meanings "behind" these tokens.
A concept of, say, an object, a property of an
object, a process, etc. is derived from verbal 
statements on these as subjects and may therefore be
defined as the whole of true and possible predicates
that can be collected on a given subject.  It is
from these predicates that the characteristics of the
corresponding concepts can be derived.  Common
characteristics in different concepts lead to
relations between concepts, which relations in turn are
factors for the formation of concept systems.
Different kinds of relationships as well as different
kinds of concepts are distinguished.  It is pointed
out that an orderly supply of the elements for 
propositions (information statements) on new knowledge
requires the construction and availability of such
concept systems.

Impact of Scientific Serials on the Advancement of Medical
Knowledge:  An Objective Method of Analysis
.A
Sengupta, I.N.
.W
  A common tool for the selection of serial publications for a research
library is the lists of most cited serials.  The possibilities of this method
were first studied by Gross and Gross who in 1927 applied a method of
sample statistical investigation to the grading of scientific serials
according to their relative importance based on citation counting from source
journals.

The Nature of Scientific Communication and Influence
.A
Crane, Diana
.W
   As the formal communication system of science has become less able to
supply information with the rapidity that scientists require, increasing
attention has been paid to the structure of communication in science.. How are
scientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by the
circulation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the social
organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes?
   Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of the
scientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the 
information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of the
relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For the
most part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been
conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as
has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey
and Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack of
theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the 
studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one
of these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge from
all three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will 
describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose..

The Literature of the Social Sciences: a Survey of Citation Studies
.A
Broadus, Robert N.
.W
   The great concern with scientific communication in the last few decades has 
produced a number of studies analyzing the use of information.. One approach to
these matters has been via the citation study - a method often used in the physical 
sciences, but applied less frequently in the humanities and social sciences..
However, in the latter area, enough citation studies have been completed to 
produce material for interesting comparisons..

Interactive Bibliographic Search:
The User/Computer Interface
.A
Walker, D.E.
.W
    On the 14th and 15th of January, 1971, a Workshop on "The User
Interface for Interactive Search of Bibliographic Data Bases" was held at
Ricky's Hyatt House in Palo Alto, California.  The Workshop, sponsored by
the Information Systems committee of the American Federation of
Information Processing Societies, brought together a group of information
scientists who have been directly involved with this subject area.  They were
provided in advance with a "Challenge" paper and with a number of papers
prepared in response to that challenge.  The Workshop sessions themselves
were devoted exclusively to focussed discussions of the material and of the
problems in and the prospects for more effective systems design of the user
interface.  The content of these two days of deliberation prompted making
the substance of the Workshop experience available to a larger audience.
This book is intended to accomplish that goal.

    The Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications of
the National Library of Medicine, in conjunction with the NLM Library
Operations staff, initiated in June 1970 a new experimental service called
AIM-TWX (Abridged Index Medicus-TWX) to provide rapid, responsive
searching of the medical literature.
    This experiment is being conducted to identify the need for and
usefulness of such services to help medical practitioners situated in isolated
areas, to assist in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education,
and to provide information precisely when and where it is needed for health
care.  A limited group of practitioners, students, and librarians is being given
access to the system so that it will not be overloaded and rejected because of
busy signals, and so that a variety of user groups can test it.

  University printing presses exist, and are subsidized by the Government for
the purpose of producing books which no one can read; and they are true to their
high calling.  Books are the sources of material for lectures.  They should be
kept from the young; for to read books and remember what you read, well
enough to reproduce it, is called 'cramming', and this is destructive of all 
true education.  The best way to protect the young from books, is, first, to 
make them in such a way that no one can find them without several years' 
training.  A lecturer is a sound scholar, who is chosen to teach on the ground
that he was once able to learn.  Eloquence is not permissible in a lecture; it
is a privilege reserved by stature for the Public Orator.

The Intergroup Conflict
.A
Sherif, M.
.W
    In one broad category of theories, the problems are expressed
in terms of actualities of events in group relations as they
exist in everyday life.  On the whole, theories advanced by
many social scientists fall in this broad category.  In this
concern over actualities the problem is frequently not stated and
discussion not developed in a way that can be tested rigorously.
In the second broad category of theories, problems are stated
and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearing
concepts and units of analysis.  Theories coming from psychologists
and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within
this broad category.  In this line of approach, theories are
advanced without due regard to actualities, and consequently
they are plagued with serious questions of validity.

Interlibrary Loan Involving Academic Libraries
.A
Thomson, S.K.
.W
  Interlibrary loan transactions involving academic libraries in the United
States numbered over 800,000 items in 1963-64.  This number is growing
exponentially.  Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third
of the interlibrary loan requests they receive.  Unfilled interlibrary loans
are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the
usefulness of the service to the reader.  Many of these interlibrary loan
failures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lending
libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and
by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted.

Interlibrary Loan Policies Directory
.A
Thomson, S.K.
.W
    In 1972-73 approximately 194,000 interlibrary loan requests
were not filled because the borrowing library in ignorance
requested non-circulating material contrary to the
interlibrary lending policies of the lending library.  These
unfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lending
libraries over $400,000 in wasted manpower, besides 
disappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials.
Much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries check
in advance the lending policies before sending requests.
    The major elements determining whether or not libraries
receive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance are
whether the library lists unusual materials in union lists,
especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OF
SERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strong
collections in a subject field listed in library directories.
Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type of
lending library, the size of collection, budget for current    
acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopy
charges, population density in neighboring states, proximity
to other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings in
the National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers.

Interlibrary Requests
.A
Ash, L.

  Our survey, in other words, is offered within the bounds of descriptive
or deductive statistics which seeks to analyze a group, not attempt to estimate
the parameters of that population of which the group has been chosen as a
sample.  The latter role is assumed by inductive statistics which makes use
of probability sampling. Accordingly, our data are presented in those forms
and with those statistical measures appropriate to the methods of descriptive
statistics: arrays, frequency distributions, breakdowns by categories which
seem of optimum value to the librarian and administrator, e.g., the frequency
of requests for journals versus monographs, the age of journals requested,
the types and ages of materials requested by the various types of libraries
(university, pharmaceutical, etc.).  The tables are arranged to give evidence
of the types of frequency distribution revealed by the Survey, as well as to
indicate central tendency, dispersion, rank order, and possibly correlations
for significant factors.

An Introduction to Computers in Information Science
.A
Artandi, S.
.W
        This book is an introduction to the field of information science
and technology, with particular emphasis on document organization.
Its point of view is general in the sense that it attempts to deal with
types of problems rather than particular systems.  When particular
systems are described they are used as examples of systems rather
than as models.
        The method of presentation is expository at the introductory
level.  While differing points of view are frequently noted, this book
is not intended to provide definitive critical evaluation.  Relevant
research is reviewed in order to indicate current thinking and activities
in the field.

Introduction to Information Science
.A
Saracevic, T.
.W
  The main emphasis of this book is on work of a theoretical
and experimental nature rather than on practical
applications.  However, the articles selected are viewed
as having a considerable potential in two major respects:
they have important implications for the practice of
information handling, but even more important, they contain
aspects of generalization.  The book is oriented
toward basic and experimental work, such as that
performed by traditional sciences, with the hope that a
reader may find much relevant to his own interests,
educational level and background, a bridge toward
generalizations, a feeling of interconnection between
seemingly unrelated works either presented in the book or
found in the literature, an awareness of apparent gaps in
knowledge, and even ideas for practical solutions or
further theoretical or experimental work.

Introduction to Library Science:
Basic Elements of Library Service
.A
Shera,J.H.
.W
    Librarianship classifies as a social science because the library, as an
institution, is a creature of society, and its goal is the improvement of
society by helping the individual to understand himself and the world of
which he is a part.  But the library is also concerned with man as a 
rational being.  Thus, it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise.  The
traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down
and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, in
both its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the social
and physical sciences.  But we would do well to remind ourselves of the 
library's humanistic origins; otherwise, in excessive enthusiasm for the
technology of science and the social action of the behaviorist, we may lose
sight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit
in them.

Introduction to Subject Indexing; a Programmed Text
.A
Brown, A.G.
.W
  This programmed text has been developed from work initially carried out
under a research project funded by the Office for Scientific and Technical
Information (now the British Library Research and Development
Department).  The project, designed to investigate the applicability of the
techniques of programmed instruction in the teaching of practical subject
indexing, was conducted at the School of Librarianship, the Polytechnic
of North London in cooperation with the College of Librarianship Wales.
The programmed instruction course, written during this project and used
by students at both Schools of Librarianship, forms the basis of the
programmed text.
  Most of the existing programmed texts relevant to the field of practical
subject indexing are concerned with the translation stage of indexing and
aim to impart skills in the use of particular indexing languages.  Our
intention, in the above-mentioned project, was to produce a course of
programmed instruction which presented an integrated view of the basic
principles and practices of subject indexing rather than attempting to 
impart to the student a high degree of familiarity with any particular
system.

Introduction to Systems Philosophy
.A
Laszlo, E.
.W
    The general systems theory, pioneered by von Bertalanffy,
Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapoport and their collaborators, gives us a
theoretical instrument for assuring the mutual relevance of scientific
information and philosophic meaning.  Extended into a general systems
philosophy, this instrument can polarize the contemporary theoretical scene
as a magnet polarizes a field of charged particles: by ordering the formerly
random segments into a meaningful pattern.  If made good use of, this
instrument could channel to us a stream of informed as well as sophisticated
answers through the cross-fertilization of contemporary science and
philosophy.
    This, then is my credo; the conviction which led to the formulation of the
present Introduction to "systems philosophy" over a period of three years
of research in alternating states of euphoria and dejection.

Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics
.A
Lyons, J.
.W
  This is a introductory book in the sense that it does not presuppose
any previous training in the subject.  But it does assume that
the reader - especially the reader whose educational background, like
my own, is more in the 'humanities' than in mathematics and
'science' - is prepared to make a certain intellectual effort with respect
to the use of symbols and formulae.  Few subjects suffer more than
linguistics from the separation of the 'sciences' and the 'humanities'
that is still maintained in the curricula of most of our schools ad
universities.  For contemporary linguistic theory draws simultaneously,
and in roughly equal measure, upon the more traditional approach
to language that is characteristic of the 'humanities' and the more
'scientific' approach that has developed recently in connection with
advances that have been made in formal logic, computer science and
automata theory.

Introduction to University Library Administration
.A
Thompson, J.
.W
   The last ten years have witnessed the growth of
an intense public interest in university affairs.  Almost anything
to do with universities is now headline news.  Previously such attention
as they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle class
newspapers of appointments, awards and meetings, leavened once a
year by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the Boat Race.
All this has changed: as Michael Befoff comments in his book The
Plateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and more
besides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish
bowls.
   He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change: 
universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly
supported by the taxpayers' money.  They represent a massive investment
on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to
yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower.
Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country
on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more
than two hundred million pounds a year.  The total university student
population is in excess of two hundred thousand, and teaching and
research staff number approximately twenty-five thousand.

Indivisible Colleges; Diffusion of Knowledge in Scientific Communities
.A
Crane, D.
.W
  In the last two decades, dramatic increases in the
scope and volume of scientific research have occurred, as
may be illustrated by the fact that the amount of scientific
literature is doubling approximately every ten years (Price
1963).  For the scientist who needs to locate particular items
of scientific information and for the documentation specialist
who must make them readily available, the organization and
management of this huge and expanding store of information
is a serious problem.  Increasingly radical solutions are being
proposed.  For example, some experts would like to scrap
scientific journals and distribute their contents piecemeal.
Information retrieval and delivery systems are being developed
to enable scientists to locate information quickly and effectively.

A Dynamic Programming Approach to R and D Budgeting and Project Selection
.A
Hess, Sidney W.
.W
   Contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that they
ignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the time
between a project's proposal and its commercialization.. The sequential 
decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) the
research expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable
investment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today does 
not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods..
   The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into 
account the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique of
dynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets
when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or
unconstrained.. These models also suggest a rational explanation of the 
patterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice..
   Finally, some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibit
their practical application are discussed..

The Association Factor in Information Retrieval
.A
Stiles, H. Edmund
.W
   This paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can find
documents related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exact
terms of the request, and can present these documents in the order of their
relevance to the request.. The key to this ability lies in the application of a
statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association 
between pairs of index terms.. With proper manipulation of these associations 
(entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other
words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such a
vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more
powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available
heretofore.. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list 
of request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard 
for their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and 
arranged in the order of their relevance to the request..

A Study of Methods for Systematically Abbreviating English Words and Names
.A
Bourne, Charles P.
.A
Ford, Donald F.
.W
   This study investigated various techniques for systematically abbreviating 
English words and names.. Most of the attention was given to the techniques 
which could be mechanized with a digital device such as a general purpose 
digital computer.. Particular was paid to techniques that could process 
incoming  information without prior knowledge of its existence (i.e., no table
lookups).. Thirteen basic techniques and their modifications are described..
In addition, most of the techniques were tested on a sample of several thousand
subject words and several thousand proper names in order to provide a 
quantitative measure of comparison..

Automatic Document Classification
.A
Borko, Harold
.A
Bernick, Myrna
.W
   Starting with a collection of 405 document abstracts dealing with
computers, the experiment in automatic document classification proceeds
to construct an
empirically based, mathematically derived classification system by use of a
factor analysis technique.. The documents are then classified into these 
derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification serves
as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated..
Of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue
words, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or
48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer 
formula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maron
in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of 
classification categories and a different computational formula.. The 
experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document 
classification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when 
executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification 
technique..

Semantic Clustering of Index Terms
.A
Gotlieb, C. C.
.A
Kumar, S.
.W
   A computer procedure to recognize indexing vocabularies is described..Index
terms are drawn from the vocabulary of a structured indexing system and may
consist of single words, collection of words, or syntactic phrases.. The basic
idea is that a measure of the semantic association between index terms can be 
determined from the structural relationships which the terms exhibit by their
relative positions in the system.. The association measure, which is based on a 
priori (preassigned) semantic relationships between terms, rather than their 
co-occurrence in a document corpus, is then for grouping index terms into 
clusters or concepts.. Some results of an experimental investigation are 
presented..
   Information, retrieval, clustering, index terms, semantic, graphs, clusters,
associations, synonyms, subgraphs, complete, maximal, connected, component,
relevance measure, vocabulary, indexing systems, cliques..

   Memory utilization and retrieval time from direct access inverted files
are investigated as a function of the data base, the demands on it, and a 
parameter which the system designer may control.. An analysis of the effects
of data base characteristics and data base usage is also made for a linked

The Application of Pattern Recognition to Screening Prospective
Anticancer Drugs
.A
Kowalski, B.R.
.W
  Pattern recognition has been introduced to the
chemical literature as a general tool which can be used
by the chemist to reduce masses of experimental data to
relevant information.  Perhaps more importantly, it
provides connections between raw, multivariant data
and sought-for information without making restrictive
assumptions about the underlying statistics of the data.
The general problem has been stated as follows.  Given
a collection of objects and a list of measurements made
on each object, is it possible to find and/or predict a
property of the objects that is not directly measurable
but is known to be related to the measurements via
some unknown relationship?  The only assumption
made is that similarities and dissimilarities among
objects are reflected in at least some of the
measurements.

Stereochemically Unique Naming Algorithm
.A
Wipke, W. Todd
Dyott, Thomas M.
.W
   An algorithm has been developed and implemented to generate for each 
chemical structure a unique and invariant linear name which includes double 
bond and asymmetric carbon isomerism.. A logical proof is given for the 
one-to-one correspondence between name and structure.. By inspection of the
linear names of two structures, one can determine if the two structures are
identical, nonisometric, constitutionally isometric, diastereometric, or
enantiometric.. The algorithm determines the true stereocenters and calculates
a reduced set of chiral centers, Src.. It is proven that if three are any 
centers in Src that the compound must be chiral; an a chiral compound must have 
Src = null.. Extensions of the algorithm are outlined to allow uniquely naming 
conformational isomers..

Deriving Term Relations for a Corpus by Graph Theoretical Clusters
.A
Augustson, J.G.
Minker, J.
.W
  We discuss how alternative methods of automatic
term clustering may provide insight into how terms are
related within a corpus.  The work reported uses a
corpus of 2267 documents that contain 3950 index
terms.	A similarity matrix is developed using the
document - term matrix.  A threshold level T is applied to
the similarity matrix.  Entries in the matrix that are
greater than or equal to the threshold level are set
equal to one, and the remaining entries are set to zero.
  Three definitions are applied to the corresponding
graph of each threshold matrix to develop clusters.
These are, (1) the connected components of the graph,
(2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the graph, and
(3) the combined maximal complete subgraphs of the
graph as described that show how insight may be
gained into the term relations by varying the threshold
levels and the cluster definitions.

Automatic Abstracting and Indexing..
II. Production of Indicative Abstracts by Application of Contextual 
Inference and Syntactic Coherence Criteria
.A
Rush, J. E.
Salvador, R.
Zamora, A.
.W
   Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors 
of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic 
generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis
to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval
systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the
purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the 
automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the 
original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which 
various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop 
criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract 
can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to 
the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most
significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and
rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence
reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic
abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called 
the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions
specified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of
sufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods
of the automatic abstracting system is warranted..

Linguistics and Information Science
.A
Montgomery, C.A.
.W
  This paper defines the relationship between linguistics
and information science in terms of a common interest
in natural language.  The notion of automated processing
of natural language - i.e., machine simulation of
the language processing activities of a human - provides
novel possibilities for interaction between linguists,
who have a theoretical interest in such activities,
and information scientists, who have more practical
goals, e.g. simulating the language processing activities
of an indexer with a machine.
  The concept of a natural language information system
is introduced as a framework for reviewing automated
language processing effort by computational
linguists and information scientists.  In terms of this
framework, the former have concentrated on automating
the operations of the component for content analysis
and representation, while the latter have emphasized
the data management component.  The complementary
nature of these developments allows the
postulation of an integrated approach to automated
language processing.  This approach, which is outlined
in the final sections of the paper, incorporates current
notions in linguistic theory and information science, as
well as design features of recent computational linguistic
models.

   A combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses were used on the
journal articles indexed in one volume of Library Literature.. Findings
include: the dispersion of a articles among journals followed a Bradford-type
distribution except for a "collapse" at the end, possibly showing low level of
interaction of librarianship with other fields; considerable proportion of
articles was of news-type; administration was the largest single subject 
covered.. The methodology may be appropriate for analysis of activities in 
other fields..

A Decision Theory View of the Information Retrieval Situation:
An Operations Research Approach
.A
Kraft, Donald H.
.W
   A decision theory approach is used to model the information retrieval 
decision problem of which documents to retrieve from a library collection in 
response to a specific user query for information.. A thorough discussion of
decision theory, including the components of the alternatives,states-of-nature,
outcomes, and evaluations - as well as of the optimization process under the 
cases of certainty, risk, and uncertainty - is presented.. Bayesian statistics
are also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents 
via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. An 
example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and to
compare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with and
without document classification information..
   Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to model
the retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and to
demonstrate the value of prior information via document classification 
analysis.. Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, an
overall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem,
incorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation,
which allows one to better understand the contributions made by many 
researchers in this crucial area..

   A study was undertaken to classify mechanically a document collection using 
the free-language words in the titles and abstracts of a corpus of 261 physics

closely duplicated the clusters obtained by previous experiments with 
citations.. A brief comparison is made with a traditional manual classification
system.. It is shown that the mechanical procedure is capable of achieving 
simultaneous average relevance and recall figures above 80%..

Probabilistic Models for Automatic Indexing
.A
Bookstein, A.
Swanson, D.R.
.W
  This paper is developed in two stages.  The first
stage describes an experiment that explores properties
of the class of words that are not useful in conveying
subject meaning and distinguishes them from those
classes of words that do convey subject meaning to
various degrees.  In particular, we study the clustering
properties of these words; the analysis is based on
statistical properties alone, and techniques are
introduced that may be of value in other areas of
information science.  On the basis of the results of this
experiment, a model of word occurrences is introduced and
discussed.  Later papers by us and by Harter will apply
this model to indexing.

Functions of a Man-Machine Interactive Information Retrieval System
.A
Williams, J. H. Jr.
.W
   An effective man-machine interactive retrieval system is not achieved by
simply placing a terminal on each end of an existing machine retrieval system..
An interactive system requires a sequence of steps in which man and machine
alternately take action.. It should also provide different levels of services
to experienced and inexperienced searchers, recognize the difference between a
narrow and broad query, furnish clues as to the next direction to be searched, 
recognize the data base dynamically as the searcher changes his viewpoint, 
provide a ranking of responses in the most likely sequence and offer the 
searcher the option of overriding the ranking when a particular term is of 
extreme significance..
   An online interactive system meeting many of these needs has been developed
and tested.. The objectives of the development of this system, BROWSER, was to
investigate the effectiveness of a free-form query with a combinatorial search
algorithm and the effectiveness of various techniques and components to 
facilitate online browsing..

Overlap in the Lists of Journals Monitored by Biosis, CAS, and Ei
.A
Wood, James L.
Flanagan, Carolyn
Kennedy, H. E.
.W
   In April 1970, the BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts, 
the Chemical Abstracts Service, and Engineering Index, Inc. began a five-part
study to determine the relationships between and the overlap in coverage in
their printed publications and computer-readable services.. This study was 
designed to provide information needed by these three accessing services for 
planning future cooperative programs and for reconciling differences in policies
and practices so as to make their publications and services more useful to their
user communities..
   This paper is based on the first part of the study, which compared listings 
of the journals each service was routinely monitoring as of 1 May 1970.. Of the
14,592 different journals monitored, 1% were monitored by all three of the
services, 27% were monitored by two of the three services, and 72% were 
monitored by only one of the three services.. Subsequent phases of the study
will determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles within
the journals..

Structure and Effectiveness of The Citation Identifier, an
Operational Computer Program for Automatic Identification of Case
Citations in Legal Literature
.A
Borkowski, Casimir
Cepanec, Louis
Martin, J. Sperling
Salko, Virginia
Treu, Siegfried
.W
   A computer program for automatic identification of "full form" case
citations in legal literature (e.g., Rutherford v. Geddes, 4 Wall. 220,
18 L. Ed. 343; Southland Industries, Inc. v. Federal Communications
Commission, 1938, 69 App. D.C., 82, 99 F.2D 117) has been developed
by this group and is now operational.. 
   The level of performance of this program known as "The Citation
Identifier" is high.. In a recent computer run, The Citation
Identifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisions
of U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) and 
located correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227
(that is, better than 99% of the total).. Only seven misses and three
false drops occurred..
   Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) were
identified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identifications
containing two types of errors:  (1) partial identifications in which some
citation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program ("short hits");
and (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly included
in the citations ("long hits").
   Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible and
can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program..
   The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run,
the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of text
was approximately 15 1/2 minutes.. This speed could be further increased
by suitable changes in the computer program..
   An extension of The Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations (e.g.,
"the Geddes decision", "the Southland Industries case") is now in preparation..

Title Indexes as Alerting Services in the Chemical and Life Sciences
.A
Bottle, Robert T.
.W
   The principles underlying alerting services are discussed.. General alerting
services (as distinct from SDI systems) need to transfer to their users a large 
quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible..
As title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common, the user 
needs to know how much significant information is not discernible from a 
documents title.. This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject and
type of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made,
ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about one
third of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and other
nomenclature problems are discussed.. Delay times and time of use are the two 
most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for 
some typical services..

Evaluation of a KWIC Index for Library Literature
.A
Brodie, N.E.
.W
  A librarian attempting to do a literature search currently
faces an eight-month gap in access to the literature of
his field through Library Literature.  In April 1968,
librarians made a rare examination of their own literature
and considered this gap and other information problems
in librarianship.  The Albany Conference on the Bibliographic
Control of Library Science Literature recommended the
establishment of a fast announcement service for library
schools (1).  A monthly Keyword in Context (KWIC) index
serving the whole range of information-oriented professions 
was a specific proposal which was favored by one conference
group to meet the need for current information (2).

The Practice of Charging Users for Information Services: A State of the Art
Report
.A
Penner, Rudolf J.
.W
   The state of the art literature review disclosed that society has not yet
come to the point that paying for library information services is a common 
thing.. It was also found that a sound basis for determining the costs of the
services - let alone charge for them - does not exist: While some data on 
specific cost for unit operations are available, it is very difficult to 
compare the data and arrive at meaningful figures.. Nevertheless, there is an
indication that large operating centers are becoming concerned with cost to the
point that they are cost-according their operations, which would permit them
to establish realistic fees for their services..

Towards a Metascience of Information:  Informatology
.A
Otten, Klaus 
.A
Debons, Anthony
.W
   Arguments are advanced to suggest that information and operations on 
information are phenomena, the principles of which provide the basis for a
metascience of information  (informatology).. The fundamental character of the
phenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing and
communication functions.. The role of the metascience is dictated by several
factors, namely, the need for a common basis upon which all information-
oriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied,
a common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concerned
in some form or other with information on one side and man's relationship
to the phenomena on the other side..  The content of the postulated metascience
of information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problems
for which the science has to provide answers and solutions.. It is suggested
that an educational concept responsive to the needs of metascience of 
information be developed and implemented..

An Evaluation of Index Medicus and MEDLARS in the Field of Ophthalmology
.A
Virgo, Julie A.
.W
   An evaluation of the performance of Index Medicus and MEDLARS in the field
of ophthalmology is presented, using data generated by a separate study..
MEDLARS performance figures gave a screened precision ratio of 54% and a recall
ratio of 42%.. Over the same set of questions Index Medicus had a screened 
precision ratio of 53% and a recall ratio of 46%.. Results for Index Medicus 
alone over a large set of questions gave a 73% screened precision ratio and a 
47% recall ratio.. A random sample of MEDLARS and Index Medicus precision and 
recall failures showed that most of the Index Medicus recall failures resulted
from manual searcher omission.. The major causes of Medlars precision failures 
were inadequate indexing terminalogy to express concepts and attempts at
providing too exhaustive a search..

Obsolescence of Special Library Periodicals: Sampling Errors and
Utility Contours
.A
Brookes, B. C.
.W
   Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets
of periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively large
errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are 
analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and
because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on
obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated..
   When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still
remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals
that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than
those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept
of "utility contours" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p%
library..
   It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; 
every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggest
new measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques that
are applicable to any other special case..

These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialty
journals being published by 28 national and international societies.. The
second group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees of
the National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings..
   In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reported
to NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S.
c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not the
most quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14%
of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of the
literature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v 
journals..
   The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing and
abstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-ranking
journals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals..

Are Titles of Chemical Papers Becoming More Informative?
.A
Tocatlian, Jacques J.
.W
   The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes and
their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors' choices of titles
for their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services,
such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but
also in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such
as bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles
of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become
increasingly aware of the importance of titles as "carriers" of information..
The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers
are becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical
papers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958..
   The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 
1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words
in the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading
substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a
thesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading
substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of
a thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of
short titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958,
and 1968..
   Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are
being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative
since the advent of the KWIC index..

Toward a Theory of Indexing--II
.A
Landry, Bertrand C.
.A
Rush, James E.
.W
   The purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a basis for a
theory of information storage and retrieval.. It is believed that this theory
can best be formulated in terms of a general theory of indexing.. After stating
basic premises and defining essential concepts, the relationship between a 
theory of indexing and a theory of information storage and retrieval is 
considered.. The similarities between the indexing process and the general
communication process are discussed, and indexing is viewed as an order 
increasing (i.e., entropy decreasing) operation.. The concept of a theoretical
index is developed and contrasted with real-world indexing systems.. The
relationship between query formulation, retrieval, and benefit is discussed, 
and these notions are then related to the human performance variable.  It is 
believed that the ideas presented in this paper provide a useful framework 
for more detailed investigations into the indexing process..

The Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Information Retrieval
and Dissemination Systems
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
A distinction is made between cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-benefits
analysis as applied to information systems; and the relationship between costs,
performance, and benefits is discussed.. Some factors influencing the
cost-effectiveness of retrieval and dissemination systems are identified..
Various aspects of system operation that are susceptible to cost-effectiveness
analysis are discussed, including system coverage, indexing policies and
procedures, system vocabulary, searching procedures, and mode of interaction
between system and user.. Possible tradeoffs between input and output costs,
and the effects of these tradeoffs on cost-effectiveness are presented.

Some Remarks on Elitism in Information and the
Invisible College Phenomenon in Science
.A
De Solla Price, D.J.
.W
  Let me remind you of that famous place in Dickins'
Pickwick Papers where we hear of a researcher who
composed a copious review on Chinese Metaphysics with
the aid only of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which
contained absolutely no information on that subject.
The technique used, we are told with a nudge of
superiority, was to read for metaphysics under the
letter M, and for China under the letter C, and to
combine the information.
  I feel that we may be performing just such a miracle
of creative juxtaposition when we assume that Scientific
Information is just some special variety of information
that contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate,
pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828.  We suppose too
that Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to be
full of scientific books, and that the best possible
technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a
library qualification and combined it with the appropriate
sort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used to
say, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical
compound.  I wish to point out two simple facts:  there is
more to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage 
and retrieval of information, and there is about science
and technology something intrinsically different from
mere scholarship.

Human Factors in the Design of an Interactive Library System
.A
McAllister, Caryl
Bell, John M.
.W
   ELMS (Experimental Library Management System) is an experimental
system for total library management, operating on-line with an IBM 360
through IBM 2260 and 2741 terminals.. The system is designed to handle
large amounts of highly variable information which it processes on 
command, giving on-line computer service for all library operations..
At the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skills
of a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trained
librarians..
   Such a system presents programming problems that will be typical
of large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paper
discusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may prove
useful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (display
format, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptability
for the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-letter
mnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (line
numbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use of
default conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification;
and collection of operational statistics to help improve the system..

On-Line Systems: Promise and Pitfalls

increasingly important, both for information retrieval and library support
operations.. The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and -
if time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost of
the large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still-
high cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user-
system interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfaces
are only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by the
National Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimental
retrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineering
the right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, 
concerted effort to engineer user acceptance.. Common pitfalls here
include overselling system capabilities and failure to take into account
the social context around the user terminal.. The major national problem
is to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing
nationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data
bases that will be readily available during the next few years.. We do
not need technological breakthroughs to exploit the potential of
on-line systems, but we do need breakthroughs in organizing for
technological change..

Selected Results From An Inquiry Into Testing of
Information Retrieval Systems 
.A
Saracevic, Tefko
.W
   A variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems were
examined.. A model of a retrieval system, together with a set of measures
and a methodology for performance testing were developed.. In the main
experiment the effect on performance of the following variables
was tested:  sources of indexing, indexing languages, coding schemes,
question analyses, search strategies and formats of output.. In
addition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate
the problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The main
conclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in all
components of an IR system; length of indexes affects performance
considerably more than indexing languages; question analyses and search
strategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  more
than indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only
on a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific..
It seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring all
factors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present..

What Makes An Automatic Keyword Classification Effective?
.A
Jones, K. Sparck
.A
Barber, E. O.
.W
   Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval
purposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematic
experiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestions
have been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic
keyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classifications
should have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments we
showed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this
paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of
classification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms
of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval 
situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in 
performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that
definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification
for collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping
is confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the 
classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing
terms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword
frequency..

Machine-Assisted Approach to General Reference Materials
.A
Meredith, J. C.
.W
   A collection of 144 general reference works was analyzed and encoded
according to 254 identifiable characteristics of services and contained data,
comprising an "approach language" expressing search parametrs.. In response to
a request submitted at on-line terminal, the "REFSEARCH" system retrieves the
names of those works who profiles meet or exceed the specification.. The 
background and rationale of the system is discussed, its current use in the 
School of Librarianship, University of California, and its potential for direct 
service to library patrons..

Curricula in Information Science:  Analysis and Development
.A
Belzer, J
Isaac, A
Finkelstein, E.
Williams, J.
.W
  The Curriculum Committee of the Special Interest
Group/Education Information Science of ASIS is
charged with the responsibility for determining the
scope and characteristics of information science
programs in the US and Canada in terms of Curriculum
developments and course offerings.  To fulfill this 
responsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicit
reliable information concerning courses being offered relating
to information storage and retrieval, information
science and/or documentation.  The data requested
included course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses,
textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with which
offered, etc.
  Responses were received from 45 schools, providing
information about 185 courses and 242 topics.  Using
several methods of clustering the data, it was difficult
to arrive at firm results, because of the diversity and
scatter of the topics included in this field.  It was
therefore decided to hold a workshop of experts which
would examine the validity of the questionnaire results.
  This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arrive
at consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburgh
on September 21-23, 1970.  Sixteen specialists in the
field representing universities industry and government
were brought together to participate.  Consensus was
reached in identifying nine factors which contribute to
the curriculum in information science and seven courses
which constitute the core for the Master's program.
The topics to be included in each of these courses were
also isolated.

On the Evaluation of Information Science
.A
Harmon, Glynn
.W
   The emergence and development of information science within its wider 
disciplinary framework is interpreted.. Information science is approached as
one of a modern generation of communication or behavioral disciplines which
emerged almost simultaneously around World War II.. Consequently, an attempt is
made to discern the evolution of relationship between information science and
other generation disciplines.. The internal development of information science
is first sketched.. Second, possible relationship and roles of information 
science within a potentially emergent suprasystem of knowledge are discussed..

Compound Words: A Problem in Post-Coordinate Retrieval Systems
.A
Jones, Kevin P.
.W
   Compound words cause some difficulty in post-coordinate indexing
systems:  if too many are fractured, or the wrong categories are selected
for fracturing, noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval..
Various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined which
include those for pre-coordinated or rotated, indexes..
   The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that many
compound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components,
and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Other
compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, 
while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form..
   These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from
earlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture a
term, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been
employed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA)
for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and have
enabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent..
   It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on the
application of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinate
basis..

Some Implications of Automatic Recognition of Bibliographic Elements
.A
Shoffner, Ralph M.
.W
   A theoretical approach to the problem of converting printed bibliographic 
records to machine readable form is developed based on principles of system 
analysis.. Experience from several recent projects conducted by the Institute of
Library Research, University of California, are used to illustrate how this
theoretical approach is currently being tested prior to implementation in a 
large scale conversion project..

Informal Communication Among Scientists in Sleep Research
.A
Crawford, Susan
.W
   At the frontiers of an active area of science, social structure based upon 
communication is demonstrated.. Using sociometric techniques, an informal
communication network was identified which included 73% of the scientists..
Within the network was a core group of scientists who were the focus of a
disproportionately large number of contacts and who were differentiated from
others by greater productivity, higher citation record and wider readership..
Information transferred to these scientists is so situated that it could be
transmitted to 95% of the network scientists through one intermediary scientist
or less..

The Efficiency of MEDLARS Titles for Retrieval
.A
Miller, William L.
.W
   Previous research has indicated that the titles rather than index terms 
would, in the standard MEDLARS system, gave lower Recall but higher Precision..
A title searching technique is described which allows the number of references
retrieved to be fixed before a search commences.. With this technique the
greater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The
title-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These 
queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared
with the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with 
fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 
relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the 
relative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the 
choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds..

   This paper presents a detailed analysis of the content and format of seven
machine-readable bibliographic data bases: Chemical Abstract Service 
Condensates, Chemical and Biological Activities, and Polymer Science and
Technology, Biosciences Information Service's BA Previews including Biological
Abstracts and BioReseach Index, Institute for Science Information Source Tape, 
and Engineering Index COMPENDEX..
   Selected issue test tapes of each data base were printed and checked for the
types of data that were contained in the issue and the methods in which the 
data were formatted.. This paper compared the physical formats of the tapes and
describes the varied treatments given to such data elements as authors, titles, 
abstracts, etc.. Comparison of data bases requires common use of terms.. All
terms are defined at the beginning of the paper..
   The authors found great discrepancies in the presentation of essentially 
similar bibliographic data, and they offer some suggestions for mitigating the 
discrepancies by use of standards..

   A mathematical model is presented which explains the observed exponential 
growth rates of citations and references in a scientific discipline.. The 
independent variables are the growth rate of the number of articles published 
and the decay rate of citation of old literature.. It is shown how the 
parameters of the model can be estimated..

Interface Design for An Interactive Information Retrieval System:
A Literature Survey and a Research System Description
.A
Thompson, David A., Ph.D.
.W
   This article focuses on the human interaction characteristics of an
information retrieval system, suggests some design considerations to
improve man-machine cooperation, and describes a research system at 
Stanford that is exploring some of these techniques..
   Librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naive
user formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriate
search query that maps into the retrieval system.. Consequently, the
process of query formulation by the user, interactively with the
information available in te system, remains one of the principal
problems in information retrieval today..
   In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface
communication between man and the computer, we have pursued the
objective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRT
in a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with a
light pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Using
his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction
vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a 
hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be
augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to
the user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to
replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, 
thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's problem
into the structure and vocabulary of the system..

Improving a Field-based "Eric-Like" Information System
.A
Paisley, W.
.W
  This is a period for rapid growth in information systems
for the sciences and professions.  Information centers
are springing up across the country.  Federal agencies
and private groups are both collaborating and competing
to establish comprehensive systems.
  Changing the library's name to "information center" is
more than linguistic faddism.  New, active roles subordinate
the library's traditional, passive role as a preserver
and codifier of knowledge.  "Information center"
bears analogy to "economic center" and "transportation
center."  Like these centers, its significance is in
transaction.  The significance of a transportation center
lies in routes to other centers.  The significance of an
information center lies in communication lines to knowledge 
producers and knowledge users.  Information centers are
judged by their information "throughput," not by their 
"holdings."

A new comparison Between Conventional Indexing (MEDLARS) 
and Automatic Text Processing (SMART)
.A
Salton, G.
.W
   A new testing process is described designed to compare conventional retrieval
(MEDLARS) and automatic text analysis methods (SMART).. The results obtained 
with a collection of documents chosen independently of either SMART or MEDLARS
indicate that a simple automatic extraction of keywords from document abstracts
produces a 30 to 40 percent loss compared with MEDLARS indexing.. A replacement
of the unranked Boolean searches used in MEDLARS by the standard ranked output 
normally provided by SMART reduces the loss to between 15 and 20 percent.. When
automatically generated word control list or a thesaurus is used as part of the 
SMART analysis, the results are comparable in effectiveness to those obtained 
by the intellectual MEDLARS indexing.. Finally, the incorporation of user 
feedback procedures into SMART furnishes an improvement over the normal MEDLARS 
output of 15 to 30 percent.. 
   One concludes again that no technical justification exists for maintaining 
controlled, manual indexing in operational retrieval environments..

   A selected sample of U.K. University, industrial and Government scientists
were given a current-awareness service for 18 months, in order to investigate
the practicability and problems of such a service.. Six hundred profiles were 
run, using the natural-language data bases Chemical Titles and 
Chemical-Biological Activities produced by Chemical Abstracts Service..
   Precision and recall were measured, and correlations between profile
performance and such factors as subject area and profile logic were 
investigated statistically.. Precision and recall failures were analyzed and 
various improvements to the system were suggested as a consequence..
   It was concluded that a viable computerized current-awareness service based 
on searching natural language could be created..

The Development of a Semantic Differential to
Assess Users' Attitudes Towards An On-line Interactive
Reference Retrieval System
.A
Katzer, Jeffrey
.W
   A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which can
be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or
concepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on
which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest..
To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the
development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more
independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify
those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented
reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..
   Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference
retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same
19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor 
analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was 
labeled "evaluative-specific" and accounted for over 23% of the total
variance.. Factor II was called "desirability"; it accounted for over 
17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled "enormity" accounted
for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor
structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three
dimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more general
class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system
evaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..
   In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective
scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions..
Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD..
The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure
and the need for a predicative replication of the study..

What Information Dissemination Studies Imply Concerning the Design of
On-Line Reference Retrieval Systems*
.A
Back, Harry B.
.W
   The use of an on-line computer system for locating bibliographic citations
has been hailed as an important innovation for coping with the "information
explosion.." However, on-line reference retrieval is only one element in a
large social system of information dissemination.. To have a widespread impact,
an on-line system must compete successfully with a multitude of other sources
of references.. This paper reviews studies of information dissemination as a
basis for determining how on-line retrieval can best compete.  It recommends
the functional groups for whom an on-line system should be designed and the
forms of written media that should be included in the system's initial data
base.. Finally, it presents criteria the system should satisfy to be as widely
used and as comprehensive as other reference retrieval methods..

   A surprising difference is found in the acceptance of on-line bibliographic 
search between university research workers and students in the classroom.. The
typical research worker, even after careful preparation and individual help, 
abandons the on-line system in favor of more traditional searching techniques..
The student and the seminar participant, on the other hand, take to this new 
tool with enthusiasm and profit.. Bibliographic data bases in physics, 
astronomy and urban systems are available to users through on-line access to 
the Remote Information Query System (RIQS).. Examples of introductory on-line 
sessions are presented and a report of one of the professors participating is 
included..

Citation Patterns fo the Cardiovascular Serial Literature
.A
McMurtray, Frances
.A
Ginski, John M.
.W
   In an attempt to further amplify the characteristics of the cardiovascular
serial literature, citation patterns were studied.. As previously shown, 
one-third of the 5,860 papers from the National Heart Institute grantees for
1967 appeared within 13 journals (3).. After the exclusion of the abstract
journals, the remaining journals were used to obtain a basic pool of 300
cardiovascular related articles.. Science Citation Index was used to
gather statistics relative to citing author, journal and year.. The 300
articles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2,545 times during this
four-year period (1967-1970).. The figures concerning citation rate by
year serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak during
the third year after publication.. Also some definite patterns of self-citation
were noted.. It was found that, when analyzed on the basis of first author, 
15 percent of the 2,545 citations were self-citations.. The ten basic 
journals tend to be cited mostly within themselves; one-third of the
citations were found in these journals.. Although the citations were
found throughout 349 journals, indicating an extensive scatter, a
relatively high percentage of papers were found in few journals..

The Use Patterns of Physics Journals in a Large Academic Research Library
.A
Chen, Ching-Chih
.W
   The purpose of this investigation was to reveal the use of patterns of the
physics journals in the M.I.T. Science Library.. The findings are based upon
an analysis of actual use data recorded from all volumes and issues left by
library users on study tables and on trucks in the photocopy area from
March 15 to June 31, 1971.. The Science Library contains some 220 physics
journals.. The study reveals that only 138 journals (62.7%) were used even
once during the 3 1/2-month interval.. A core of 49 journals supplies 90%
of use, and these items would cost 51.1% of the total single subscription
costs of the 138 used titles:  52.3% of use occurs in journal volumes less
than 6 years old.. English is the most used language of physics journals and
the English journals account for 95.3% of use.. American journals, 57.2% of
which are published by the American Institute of Physics, supply 59.4% of the
total use..

A Cost Model for Evaluating Information Retrieval Systems    
.A
Cooper, Michael D.
.W
   This paper develops a mathematical model for use in studying how to 
minimize the cost of operating a mechanized retrieval system.. Through 
the use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparative
evaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides the
costs of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs..
In addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performance
level of the system and the combination of user and systems time that is
expended in working with the system.. This minimizes the total cost of
operating the system.. The allocation is done for a given performance level
and for a given cost per unit of user and system time..

A Bibliometric Analysis of Certain Information Science Literature
.A
Donohue, Joseph C.
.W
   Several bibliometric techniques previously applied to 
separate scientific literatures were used together in the analysis of a
single corpus of journal articles relating to information science.. 
Techniques included are (a) Bradford analysis, (b) epidemic analysis, 
(c) identification of research front, and (d) bibliographic coupling.. 
Similar analysis was made of writings cited by the main corpus articles, 
and of the literature which in turn cites the main corpus.. Results
were analyzed in terms of structure and processes observable in patterns
of authorship, publication, and citation.. Their significance is discussed
with potential application of the method to the solution of problems in the
management of large research libraries..

On-Line  Serials Control System in a Large Biomedical Library;
1) Description of the System
.A
Fayollat, James
.W
   An on-line serials control system with particular emphasis on storage and
maintenance concepts is described.. The system, operational since January,
1971, has evolved from a former batch card system and remains completely
compatible with it.. The system allows real-time display and updating of
all elements of the file.. Consequently all check-in, bindery, and claims
operations, as well as new entries and data field changes are accomplished
on a real-time basis.. All programs are in PL/1.. Required equipment is an
IBM time-shared facility with 100 K memory available for the applications
programs, and IBM 2260 display units..
   This article is the first of three.. The second is concerned with an
analysis of inverted file retrieval features and the third compares the
operation of the on-line with the batch system, comparable manual operations,
and discusses costs..

Interrelationships of Scientific Journals
.A
Narin, Francis
Carpenter, Mark
Berlt, Nancy C.
.W
   A series of models of the interrelationship of scientific journals
has been developed from the cross citing amongst 275 journals in
mathematics, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology..    
The data source was the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived
from the Science Citation Index.. The JCI consists of a journal by
journal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index..
A large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristics
of the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clear
boundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinary
journals as cross field information links..
The separate disciplines appear to relate to each other in an orderly
manner, with a natural sequence:  mathematics --> physics --> chemistry -->
biochemistry --> biology.. Within disciplines the journals form fully
transitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..

Managing An Uncontrolled Vocabulary Ex Post Facto
.A
Lefever, Maureen
Freedman, Barbara
Schultz, Louise
.W
   Initiated as an experiment, supported by the Division of Medicinal
Chemistry of Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the operational
retrospective retrieval service offered by BIOSIS, now in its eighth year, 
exploits a file created essentially without vocabulary control.. The file
comprises some 40 million index access points to 1.87 million references
in research biology announced in Biological Abstracts and BioResearch
Index since September 1959.. A pragmatic program of file building criteria
has been pursued, originally with modest support from the Office of Science
Information Service of the National Science Foundation, which has provided
improved retrieval and an annual summary of the vocabulary of the literature
available to anyone interested (1)..

On-Line Serials Control System on a Large Biomedical Library
Part II. Evaluation of Retrieval Features
.A
Fayollat, James
.W
   The on-line serials control system in use at UCLA Biomedical Library 
utilizes an inverted file for its primary technique.. The correct title is
reached with a entry about 80% of the time by using average of three title 
words.. A detailed profile of title structure and search scheme is given..
The major determinants of the scheme are evaluated on a performance and cost
basis..

Dialectical Inquiring Systems:
A New Methodology for Information Science
.A
Mitroff, Ian I.
Williams, James
Rathswohl, Eugene
.W
   A taxonomy for modeling information systems is presented.. The taxonomy
derives from the history of modern epistemology.. Epistemology is used as a
prescriptive modeling basis because (1) the fundamental problems of 
epistemology are concerned with information, and (2), because the history of
epistemology identifies any archetypal ways that men have conceived of
information and of models..
   It is shown how the different models of epistemology can be made
scientifically operational through the use of a special kind of systems
analysis..
   Finally, the results of a preliminary experiment based on one of the models
are presented in the form of prescriptive rules for the design of future
experiments..

   Of 14,592 primary journals being collectively monitored
by the BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts
(BIOSIS), the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), and Engineering Index,
Inc. (Ei) on 1 May 1970, only 4081 were being monitored by two or more
of the services..
   The extent to which all three or any two of these services select
the same journal article for coverage was determined by examining
each service's selection records for the July 1969-June 1970 issues of
these 4081 overlap journals.. The maximum possible journal article
overlap among BIOSIS, CAS and Ei was found to be 822 articles and between
BIOSIS and Ei, 1428 articles.. The journal article overlap between
BIOSIS and CAS was found to be 48,856 articles and between CAS and Ei,
21,583 articles..

Cost Effectiveness of Current Awareness Sources in the Pharmaceutical 
Industry
.A
Ashmole, R. F.
Smith, D. E.
Stern, B. T.
.W
   In a previous paper from The Wellcome Foundation (Scott et al., 1971) a
technique was described for measuring the usefulness of a commercial data base
by comparing the choice of papers and of indexing terms to those chosen as
relevant to the organization.. In this paper we are comparing the cost 
effectiveness of several commercial data bases, journal scanning by information 
scientists, and the impact of private communication..

Clinician Search for Information
.A
Friedlander, Janet
.W
   The use of a medical library by members of the faculty of a medical school
was studied by questionnaire in an effort to ascertain the part the library
played, among channels of communication, in work-related information searches..
The study described the population of users and the kinds of sources
they utilized in an information search, in an effort to identify the factors
influencing their choice of kinds of sources and leading to the possibility of
predicting use of kinds of source once the characteristics of the users were
known.. It brought out a high use of sources which are accessible and easy
to use.. The tabulations show the importance of co-workers in informal
communication.. Low delegation of documentation tasks to libraries was
apparent.. The main user of the library studied was a clinician in the area of
internal medicine who used journal articles about diseases for information to
use in the treatment of his patients.. The recommendations were made that
journals should be shelved accessibly, with Index Medicus nearby.. Books
might be shelved less accessibly.. Telephone access to the library is of
major importance as is the provision of adequate photocopying facilities..

On Selecting a Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness
.A
Cooper, William S.
.W
   It is argued that a user's subjective evaluation of the personal
utility of a retrieval system's output to him, if it could be properly
quantified, would be a near-ideal measure of retrieval effectiveness..
A hypothetical methodology is presented for measuring this utility by
means of an elicitation procedure.. Because the hypothetical methodology
is impractical, compromise methods are outlined and their underlying
simplifying assumptions are discussed.. The more plausible the simplifying
assumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure..
This, along with evidence gleaned from 'validation experiments' of a certain
kind, is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure
of effectiveness to use under given test conditions..

Martin, Thomas H.
Carlisle, James
Treu, Siegfried
.W
   Since little substantiated evidence exists concerning the features that
should of should not be included in the man-machine interface of interactive
bibliographic search and retrieval (IBSR) systems, an informal survey tapping
the opinions of scientists active in this research area was conducted.. An
analysis of the responses showed a significant level of agreement concerning
interface features..

Theoretical Foundations of Thesaurus-Construction and
Some Methodological Considerations for Thesaurus-Updating
.A
Kim, Chai
.W
   It was argued that the present-day thesaurus-construction and maintenance
rules and conventions are not theoretically based.. For this reason, there
are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently, 
most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and
retrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to 
investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. 
The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors
and readers is linear in nature ("one-way" communication allowing no 
reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated
by both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri
viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic
process of communication ("both-way" communication).. The survey
indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely
done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of
thesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued that
such a theory, if developed, should at least account for the concepts
of meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, two
techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating
of a thesaurus..

The Environment of Classification:
The Concept of Mutual Exclusivity
.A
Jones, Kevin P.
.W
   It has been suggested that information science is still of the stage
of alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its
philosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the
observable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series of
examples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches
and man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like
continental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also
considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem..
   Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mental
powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive
series of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive
thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and
this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, it
is observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard to
existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an
integrated approach to problems..

   This article deals with the promotion of information services, specifically
the formation and subsequent evaluation of different promotional programs
for selective dissemination of information (SDI) services provided by the
Mechanized Information Center (MIC) at the Ohio State University.. Three
programs -- opinion leadership, "blitz," and telephone solicitation -- 
were developed.. Data were collected to show, for each of the programs:  
(1) the level of market penetration achieved; (2) the level of user
satisfaction generated from the service; (3) the effect in terms of
influence, of the various media employed; and (4) cost effectiveness..
Data analysis focused on a determination of the most effective methods
to promote SDI services..

A Novel Philosophy for the Design of Information Storage
and Retrieval Systems Appropriate for the '70's
.A
Scheffler, Frederic L.
.W
   The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of information
storage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer is
recognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effective
alternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalent
philosophy of the '60's in which many information systems designers
touted the computer as the answer to all information storage and
retrieval situations.. Important principles of information system
design incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy
for the '70's are presented.. These are:  the performance of users'
needs studies by the representative small group technique; the
analysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority; 
the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable
existent information storage and retrieval system from those available; 
the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing
a model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the final
design of a cost-effective system.. A number of pitfalls arising from
earlier design methodologies are pointed out, and the avoidance of these
pitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed..

A General Statistical Model for Estimating Future Demand Levels of Data-Base
Utilization Within an Information Retrieval Organization
.A
Ware, Glenn O.
.W
   A statistical model for characterizing the growth patterns of data base
utilization and for estimating future utilization levels of demand has been
developed for information retrieval organizations.. The model developed is
y = b( 1 - e(**-at) ) where y is the number of users of a data base at time t,
and a and b are parameters to be estimated.. Illustrations of the model applied 
to a typical information retrieval organization are given and discussed..

Co-citation in the Scientific Literature: A New Measure of the
Relationship Between Two Documents
.A
Small, Henry
.W
   A new form of document coupling called co-citation is defined as the
frequency with which two documents are cited together.. The co-citation
frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists
of citing documents in the Science Citation Index and counting identical 
entries.. Networks of co-cited papers can be generated for specific
scientific specialties, and an example is drawn from the literature
of particle physics.. Co-citation patterns are found to differ 
significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agree
generally with patterns of direct citation.. Clusters of co-cited
papers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science..
They may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of SDI 
profiles..

Use of an Automatic Text Analyzer in Preparation of SDI Profiles
.A
Carroll, John M.
Tague, Jean M.
.W
   The conventional method of preparing SDI (Selective Dissemination of
Information) profiles often necessitates detailed interview sessions between 
the client and one or more information scientists.. This research shows that by
submitting samples of the client's recent professional reading material to 
automatic text analysis, SDI profiles can be prepared that result in 
significantly higher initial recall scores than do those prepared by 
conventional techniques; relevance scores are not significantly different..

On Selecting A Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness
Part II. Implementation of the Philosophy
.A
Cooper,  William S.
.W
   It was argued in Part I (see JASIS, March-April 1973 p. 87) that the best
way to evaluate a retrieval system is, in principle at least, to elicit
subjective estimates of the system's utility to its users, quantified in
terms of the numbers of utilities (e.g. dollars) they would have been willing
to give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system; and a naive
methodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis..
But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises
the questions:	How can one decide which practical measure is likely to
yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And
how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying
the measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to
these problems are taken up.. The first answers the questions in terms
of the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from
the naive measure to the proposed substitute.. The second answers it by
experimentation..

Clustering of Scientific Journals
.A
Carpenter, Mark P.
Narin, Francis
.W
A cluster analysis procedure is described in which 188 journals in the
discipline of physics, chemistry and molecular biology are grouped into 
clusters.. Most of the clusters are easily identified as subdisciplinary
subject areas.. The data source was the cross citing amongst the journals
derived from the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived in turn from
the Science Citation Index (SCI).. The JCI consists of journal by journal
tabulation of citings to and from each journal processed in the SCI..
Two-step citation maps linking the clusters are presented for each 
discipline.. Within the disciplines the clusters of journals form fully
transitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..

not documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasions
determined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of the
techniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, "answer-passages" are
retrieved.. An "answer-passage" is a passage which is either answer-providing
or "answer-indicative," i.e., it permits inferring that the document 
containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., 
single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages
for screening retrieval output..
   Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation
between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates
syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening "syntactic
joints" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation
marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word
proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well..
   The computer uses "enclosure" and "connector words" for determining
when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure
was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, 
which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers..
   In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two 
answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of
one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure
of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they
retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, 
which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results..
   The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in
this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the
study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a "soft science," and
it is reasonable to hope that in less "soft" sciences and technologies
the techniques described will work even better.. On this basis a 
dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted..

Breaking the Communication barrier Between Searcher and Literature 
File: An Interactive Guide
.A
Schultz, Louise
.W
   The challenges of design of programming systems, file organization
and manipulation, and user-oriented query languages have held the spotlight
in the development of data processing support to systems for retrieval of
scientific literature.. At BIOSIS, development of such a system from the
pragmatic viewpoint of providing viable self-supporting retrieval service
from a data base of more than two million references has resulted in
focusing attention on supporting the formulation of the information need into
an effective computer search specification.. Developed under CPS and now
implemented under CICS, the program claims no novelty of structure or 
technique, but constitutes an innovation in application and goal with primary
emphasis on accommodating the behavior of a user not previously knowledgeable
about the structure, indexing language, and detailed content of a machine
based references file..

Densities of Use, and Absence of Obsolescence,
in Physics Journals at M I T
.A
Sandison, Alexander
.W
   Chen's data for the raw frequency of use of 138 physics journals in the
science library at M I T are re-examined and converted to densities of
use-per-meter of shelf.. Other units of size for obtaining densities,
and their measurement are discussed.. There is no evidence for synchronous
obsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals: instead there is
some statistically significant evidence of greater density of use with
greater age.. Similar evidence elsewhere is cited.. The ranking order for
heaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequencies
to densities of use.. 
   It is suggested that, for comparing the relative values of different
journals, or age groups, in library use or citation studies, analyses of
raw frequencies are valueless, and indeed potentially dangerously misleading, 
until they are converted to allow for the numbers of available items in each 
group examined..

Costs and Effectiveness in the Evolution of an Information System:
A Case Study
.A
Standera, Oldrich R.
.W
   With budget constraints, the problems of cost and effectiveness have 
advanced to the top of priority list of all information services managers..
Determining and monitoring effectiveness should be cost-effective also..
   The author traces the cost-effectiveness problems back to the genesis of an 
information system.. Performance parameters and their shifting in the desired 
direction are briefly discussed.. The monthly statement is intended to assist a
manager in budgeting and planning and it should also alert him to any 
irregularities in costs and effectiveness, either in time or among individual 
services.. If adopted more widely it could even serve as a means of comparison 
between centers if due consideration is given to varying conditions..

The Scientific Premises of Information Science
.A
Rosenberg, Victor
.W
   Throughout my years of work as an information scientist I have been
plagued by a personal and professional sense of doubt with respect to the
field.. A central theme of every conference that I have attended related
to:  "What is information science?" Or "Is information science a science?"
In this paper I hope to take these questions head on.. I must begin by
saying that I do take information science seriously as a science.. I see
it as the quest for understanding of the nature of information and
man's interaction with it.. That we lack so much in this quest for
understanding is the greatest challenge of the science..
   I intend to explore the tradition, or world view, bearing on the
scientific study of information.. The currently prevalent world view is
the scientific tradition which extends from the Enlightenment to
the present.. I also intend to look critically at what I perceive
to be te premises underlying most of our current efforts to understand
the phenomenon of information.. The criticism will by necessity be
speculative.. I intend to stick my neck out, not because I can prove
my assertions, but because I believe these ideas must be discussed..

Representation of Concept Relations Using the TOSAR System of
the IDC: Treatise III on Information Retrieval Theory
.A
Fugmann, Robert
Nickelsen, Herbert
Nickelsen, Ingeborg
Winter, Jakob H.
.W
   Successful information retrieval from a mechanized file is heavily
dependent on the fidelity of the representation of concepts in the
particular language of the system and on the predictability of this
representation.. 
   If an index language is employed, predictability is guaranteed and
the quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelity
of the representation, i.e., by the extent to which conceptual
distortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided.. The various
index languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differences
in their performance are correspondingly great..
   The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages
is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships
among concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing and
retrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such a
graph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between these
points represent concept relations.. In a special field of chemistry,
these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of a
document to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural language
text..

Making On-Line Search Available in an Industrial Research Environment
.A
Lawrence, Barbara
Weil, Ben H.
Graham, Margaret H.
.W
   On-line interactive searching of several information bases through several
service operators was introduced in an industrial research environment.. 
Thorough knowledge of the information base and its structure in the search
system is a major factor of successful searching, and differences among search
systems do not present serious barriers.. This new technique was most 
effectively used when the information specialist and the scientist searched as
a team.. On-line searching is now an established search tool at Exxon Research
and Engineering Company..

A Theory of Term Importance in Automatic Text Analysis
.A
Salton, G.
Yang, C. S.
.W
   A good deal of work has been done over the years in an attempt to use 
statistical or probabilistic techniques as a basis of automatic indexing and
content analysis.. 
   Unfortunately, many of these methods are lacking in effectiveness, and the
more refined procedures are computationally unattractive..
   A new technique, known as discrimination value analysis, ranks the text 
words in accordance with how much they are able to discriminate the documents
of a collection from each other; that is, the value of a term depends on how
much the average separation between individual documents changes when the given 
term is assigned for content identification.. The best words are those which
achieve the greatest separation.. 
   The discrimination value analysis is computationally simple, and it assigns 
a specific role in content analysis to single words, juxtaposed words and 
phrases, and word groups or thesaurus categories..  Experimental results are 
given showing the effectiveness of the technique..

A Decision Theoretic Foundation for Indexing
.A
Bookstein, Abraham
Swanson, Don R.
.W
   The indexing of a document is among the most crucial steps in preparing that 
document for retrieval.. The adequacy of the indexing determines the ability of 
the system to respond to patron requests.. This paper discusses this process,
and document retrieval in general, on the basis of formal decision theory.. The
basic theoretical approach taken is illustrated by means of a model of word 
occurrences in documents in the context of a model information system; both 
models are fully defined in this paper.. Though the main purpose of this paper
is to provide insights into a very complex process, formulae are developed that 
may prove to be of value for an automated operating system..The paper concludes
with an interpretation of recall and precision curves as seen from the point of 
view of decision theory..

Creation and Use of Citation Data Bases: A Modest Proposal
.A
Waters, Samuel T.
.W
   Improvement in the production and use of citations to research literature 
calls for coordination of activities by a number of abstracting and indexing 
services.. The Ohio College Library Center (OCLC) has developed a cost-effective
on-line shared cataloging system, now in widespread use by U.S. libraries.. It 
could readily serve as a pattern for a system to create and share descriptive 
indexing on-line.. A proposed system is outlined, possible developers are noted,
and further action is urged..

Performing Evaluation Studies in Information Science
.A
Swanson, Rowena Weiss
.W
   This paper considers conceptual and methodological components of information 
science evaluation studies.. The paper discusses the judgmental process of 
evaluation and the scientific nature of evaluation study in the context of 
purpose statements; criteria; the selection of variables and data collection 
and analysis techniques; and requirements of validity, reproducibility and 
reliability..  Industrial value analysis/engineering methodology is described
and related to assessments of information products and services.. The
state-of-the-art of evaluation study in information science is analyzed with 
respect to 1.the scope of evaluation studies; 2. the use of laboratory-type
environments; 3. the use of surrogate judges; 4. selection of variables; 5.
frequency of study; and 6. comparabilty of study results.. Evaluation study is
seen as essential to the management of information centers and systems and as
having approachable growth potential..

Optimal Resource Allocation in Library Systems
.A
Rouse, William B.
.W
   A procedure is developed for optimal allocation of resources among the many
processes of a library system.. Queueing theory is used to model processes as
either waiting or balking processes.. The optimal allocation of resources to 
these processes is defined as that which maximizes the expected value of the
decision-maker's utility function.. An application of the procedure to a 
specific library system is discussed..

User Training for On-Line Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Moghdam, Dineh
.W
   The early 1970's have clearly shown a trend toward the use of on-line systems
as the ideal medium for information retrieval.. The emphasis placed on direct 
access by the practitioners in the field, rather than delegated searches through
information specialists, leads to the growing need for an efficient design in 
training transient user groups.. Printed manuals, live help, audiovisual 
presentations and on-line instructions have all been used with varying degrees of
success.. The author contends that the use of computer-assisted instruction in 
conjunction with the on-line information retrieval system is the most promising
form of instruction in that the medium itself, as well as the message may be 
used to acquaint the novice searcher with an interactive user/system 
interface..

A Probabilistic Approach to Automatic Keyword Indexing
Part I. On the Distribution of Specialty Words
in a Technical Literature
.A
Harter, Stephen P.
.W
   The problem studied in this research is that of developing a set of
formal statistical rules for the purpose of identifying the keywords of
a document--words likely to be useful as index terms for that document..
The research was prompted by the observation, made by a number of writers,
that non-specialty words, words which possess little value for indexing
purposes, tend to be distributed at random in a collection of documents..
In contrast, specialty words are not so distributed..
   In Part I of the study, a mixture of two Poisson distributions is 
examined in detail as a model of specialty word distribution, and formulas
expressing the three parameters of the model in terms of empirical
frequency statistics are derived.. The fit of the model is tested on an
experimental document collection and found to be acceptable for the
purposes of the study.. A measure intended to identify specialty words, 
consistent with the 2-Poisson model, is proposed and evaluated..

Relative Effectiveness of Titles, Abstracts, and Subject Headings 
for Machine Retrieval from the COMPENDEX Services
.A
Byrne, Jerry R.
.W
   We have investigated the relative merits of searching on titles, subject 
headings, abstracts, free-language terms, and combinations of these elements..
The COMPENDEX data base  was used for this study since it contained all of the
data elements of interest.. In general, the results obtained from the 
experiments indicate that, as expected, titles alone are not satisfactory for 
efficient retrieval.. The combination of titles and abstracts came the closest 
to 100% retrieval, with searching of abstracts alone doing almost as well..
Indexer input, although necessary for 100% retrieval in almost all cases, was
found to be relatively unimportant..

An Acquisitions Decision Model for Academic Libraries
.A
DePew, John N.
.W
   A decision model for book acquisitions has been developed to simulate the
intellectual processes used in acquiring these materials in academic libraries..
It consists of a flow chart, weighted inputs and an equation, which when solved
indicates whether a library should add the title to its collection, refer it to
a cooperative group, defer the decision or drop it altogether.. Inputs to the 
model need further study and development, but the model is a step in defining
and quantifying the decision process..

RELEVANCE: A Review of and a Framework for the Thinking on the Notion 
in Information Science
.A
Saracevic, Tefko
.W
   Information science emerged as the third subject, along with logic and 
philosophy, to deal with relevance - an elusive, human notion.. The concern 
with relevance, as a key notion in information science, is traced to the 
problems of scientific communication.. Relevance is considered as a measure of 
the effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a 
communication process.. The different views of relevance that emerged are
interpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge..
Different views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different 
points in the process of knowledge communication.. It is suggested that there 
exists an interlocking, interplaying cycle of various systems of relevances..

Thesaurus Control - the Selection, Grouping, and Cross-Referencing of Terms
for Inclusion in a Coordinate Index Word List
.A
Mandersloot, Wim G. B.
Douglas, Eleanor M. B.
Spicer, Neville
.W
   The selection, grouping and cross-referencing of the (usually single-word)
terms are based on:
   1. A systematic approach to indexing in depth, based on earlier work and 
      resulting in reasonably consistent indexing..
   2. An analytical approach to word forms in which the following categories 
      are distinguished:
      ACTION forms; MEANS-material; MEANS-machine, and MEANS-man forms; STATES;
      VARIABLES; and LATENT PROPERTIES.. For each word, those forms included in 
      a certain category are represented by a single code.. The 
      category-switching caused by prepositions must be taken into account..
   3. Criteria for term-splitting with limited semantic factoring.. Occasionally,
      semantic integration is used..
   4. Critera for dealing with antonyms, which are classified as reciprocals, 
      complements, unequivalent opposites, diametrical opposites, and 
      reversals..
   5. Introduction of conditional cross-referencing..
   6.  Recognition of multiword synonyms as the major difficulty in coordinate
       indexing..

An Analytical Model of a Library Network
.A
Nance, Richard E.
.W
   Networks and network models of industrial and military systems have received 
much attention in operation research literature.. The extension of network
modeling to library networks provides some interesting twists of the usual 
models.. A general library network is offered, a mathematical statement of the 
network problem is given, and the solution of the problem is discussed.. An
example of the use of the model in evaluation and design situations is 
provided.. The necessity for further work in both theoretical and applied areas
is cited in the summary..

The Potential Usefulness of Catalog Access Points Other
Than Author, Title, and  Subject
.A
Cooper, William S.
.W
   Library patrons who wish to obtain a known document with which they
have had prior personal contact often cannot remember the standard author-
title-subject information about it with sufficient accuracy to be able
to look it up easily in present-day card catalogs.. However, they may
remember a surprising amount of such "nonstandard" information as the
color of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could this
type of "nonstandard" information be profitably exploited in computerized
catalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely be
used, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today's
library patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantial
minority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results of
a memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of
nonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking according
to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various
nonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the average
patron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval
strategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredth
as many documents as in a random search.. This reduction factor is great
enough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many
situations..

Measures of the Usefulness of Written Technical Information
to Chemical Researchers
.A
Kegan,  Daniel L.
.W
   The effective transfer of technology involves more than just
distributing paper; it demands that useful documents be disseminated with a
minimum of useless ones.. For 1 month, 10 researchers recorded a sample of
the written technical information items that they received; 4 months later
they were interviewed to determine which of these items had proved useful, 
and in what ways..
   The results indicate that (1) a researcher will call an item "useful"
even if it does not cause him to take some action, but only has some
significance for him; (2) the more the source of an item knows about the needs
of the researcher or the more the researcher knows about an item he seeks, 
the more likely it is that the researcher will find the item useful; (3) 
no strong relationships were found between certain readily observable,
physical arrangements and information behavior; and (4) an item may prove
useful, not because of the information objectively contained in that item, 
but because the item causes a cognitive restructuring of the researcher's
mind or a "free association."
   Other studies that restrict their measures of information usefulness
to externally observable behavior or that do not carefully define usefulness
may not be validly representing usefulness to the researcher..

Standards For Writing Abstracts
.A
Weil, Ben H.
.W
   An abstract, as defined here, is an abbreviated, accurate representation
of a document.. The following recommendations are made for the guidance of
authors and editors, so that abstracts in primary documents may be both
helpful to their readers and reproducible with little or no change in
secondary publications and services..
   Prepare an abstract for every formal item in journals and proceedings,
and for each separately published report, pamphlet, thesis, monograph, 
and patent.. Place the abstract as early as possible in the document..
Make the abstract as informative as the document will permit, so that
readers may decide whether they need to read the entire document.. State the
purpose, methods results, and conclusions presented in the document, either
in that order or with initial emphasis on findings..
   Make each abstract self-contained but concise; retain the basic information
and tone of the original document..  Keep abstracts of most papers to 
fewer than 250 words, abstracts of reports and theses to fewer than 500 words
(preferably on one page), and abstracts of short communications to fewer
than 100 words.. Write most abstracts in a single paragraph.. Normally
employ complete, connected sentences; active verbs; ad the third person..
Employ standard nomenclature, or define unfamiliar terms, abbreviations, and
symbols the first time they occur in the abstract..

Criteria Used by Research and Development Engineers in the Selection 
of an Information Source
.A
Gerstberger, Peter G.
.A
Allen, Thomas J.
.W
   The criteria employed by engineers in the selection of various technical
information channels in problem-solving endeavors are investigated.. The
relationships of certain criteria identified in past research to such factors 
as frequency of channel utilization and the rate at which engineers accept or
reject technical information received from specific channels are the focal 
points of the study.. A direct relationship is founded between perceived
accessibility of information channels and several objective measures of 
utilization, whereas no definite support is found for the hypothesis that the 
channel perceived highest in technical quality are those used most frequently..

A Highly Associative Document Retrieval System
.A
Cagan, Carl
.W
   This paper describes a document retrieval system implemented with a subset of 
the medical literature.. With the exception of the development of a negative
dictionary, all system operations are completely automatic.. Introduced are
methods for computation of term-term association factors, indexing, assignment
of term-document relevance values, and computations for recall and relevance..
High weights are provided for low-frequency terms, and retrieval is performed 
directly from highly connected term-document files without elaboration.. Recall 
and relevance are based on quantitative internal system computations, and 
results are compared with user evaluations..

On Relevance, Probabilistic Indexing and Information Retrieval
.A
Maron, M. E.
.A
Kuhns, J. L. 
.W
   This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and
searching in a mechanized library system.. The notion of relevance is taken
as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative
concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. 
The resulting technique called "Probabilistic Indexing," allows a computing
machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference
and derive a number (called the "relevance number") for each document, which
is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request
ranked according to their probable relevance..
   The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library
system the cross-referencing ("see" and "see also") is based solely on
the "semantical closeness" between index terms, statistical measures of
closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given
an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine
can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant
documents that would not otherwise have been selected..
   Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library
problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of
which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference
in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents
which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..

Is Automatic Classification a Reasonable Application of Statistical
Analysis of Text?
.A
Doyle, Lauren B.
.W
   The statistical approach to the analysis of document collections and
retrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines, associative machine
searching and automatic classification.. The former approach has been
favored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for
new methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble those
of traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has been
thriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed..
   The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated
at considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support the
hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about
each document is used for input to the classification program.. Six
nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100
keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computer
runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively
from 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, and
two point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to the
range of one through eight words per document..
   Finally, the future of automatic classification and some of the practical
problems to be faced are outlined..

Automatic Indexing: An Experimental Inquiry
.A
Maron, M. E.
.W
   This inquiry examines a technique for automatically classifying (indexing)
documents according to their subject content.. The task, in essence, is to have
a computing machine read a document and on the basis of the occurrence of 
selected clue words decide to which of many subject categories the document in
question belongs.. This paper describes the design, execution and evaluation of 
a modest experimental study aimed at testing empirically one statistical 
technique for automatic indexing..

Automatic Document Classification   Part II. Additional Experiments
.A
Borko, Harold
.A
Bernick, Myrna
.W
   This study reports the results of a series of experiments in the techniques
of automatic document classification.. Two different classification schedules 
are compared along with two methods of automatically classifying documents into 
categories.. It is concluded that, while there is no significant difference in 
the predictive efficiency between the Bayesian and the factor score methods, 
automatic document classification is enhanced by the use of a 
factor-analytically-derived classification schedule.. Approximately 55 percent 
of the documents were automatically and correctly classified..

Semantic Road Maps for Literature Searchers
.A
Doyle, Lauren B.
.W
   The retrieval of documented information is one of today's most widespread
technical problems, affecting almost every large professional group, 
corporation, and government bureau.. Because document retrieval is in part an
information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in 
computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, 
and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information 
retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to
order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought
of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they
are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes -
but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material..
   Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information
retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led
primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered
around the design and operation of searching machinery..  Boundary conditions 
have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who
knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal
correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention 
has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The
resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs
of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans..
   We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking
to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and
more mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact between
the reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringly
and swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for..

Morphology of "Information Flow"
.A
Fairthorne, R.A.
.W
  Such phrases as "information flow" may be purely metaphorical, or may refer to
porterage and storage of physical documents, transmission of signals, power
required for signaling, Shannon's Selective Information, changes in the state of
one's personal knowledge, propagation of announcements concerning messages, 
social increase of awareness, propagation of or reaction to imperatives, and so
on.  These matters are distinct and must be distinguished.  Then conditions must
be stated under which one can validly speak of and measure the appropriate flow.
In this paper it is shown that within the field of Notification (mention and
delivery of recorded messages to users) there are twenty basic activities formed
by choosing triads from the six variables, Message, Code, Channel, Source,
Destination, and Designation.
  "Flow" has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common,
forming a tetrad.  Then flow or correspondence between any pair of variables is
inextricable from a conjugate flow or correspondence between the other pair.
Between any pair of endpoints there are six possibly distinct types of flow,
according to which two of the remaining four variables are directly used to
achieve the flow.

New Methods in Automatic Extracting
.A
Edmundson, H.P.
.W
  This paper describes new methods of automatically extracting documents for
screening purposes, i.e. the computer selection of sentences having the
greatest possible potential for conveying to the reader the substance of
the document.  While previous work has focused on one component of sentence
significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words),
the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic
words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence
location).
  The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology.
The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of
the above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures for
the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control
parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with
manually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposed
components dominate the frequency component in the production of better 
extracts.
  KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  automatic extracting, automatic abstracting, sentence 
selection, document screening, sentence significance, relevance, content words,
key words, pragmatic words, cue words, title words, sentence location, research
methodology, parameterization, comparative evaluation.

A Mathematical Method for Analyzing the Growth of a Scientific Discipline
.A
Goffman, W.
.W
  The spread of ideas within a scientific community and the spread of infectious
disease are both special cases of a general communication process.  Thus a
general theory of epidemics can explain the growth of symbolic logic from 1847
to 1962.  An epidemic model predicts the rise and fall of particular research 
areas within symbolic logic.  A Markov chain model of individual movement 
between research areas indicates that once an individual leaves an area he is
not expected to return.
  KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  epidemic model, epidemic process, theory of epidemics,
growth of literature, history of symbolic logic, epidemiology of symbolic logic,
epidemic curve, stochastic models, Markov chains.

The Automatic Encoding of Chemical Structures
.A
Feldman, A.
Holland, D.B.
Jacobus, D.P.
.W
  Many methods for the coding of chemical structures 
have been described in the literature.	Some methods code
the compound only partially; typical of these are the
methods using descriptor codes.  Other methods, among
which the so-called ciphers are prominent, code
compounds exhaustively.  All these methods require
cerebral effort; that is, a chemist is needed who must 
have learned the rules of the code, and who must known how
to dismember correctly each structure to be coded.  A
disadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore,
that they are not generally understood by chemists.  No
advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to
generate and how to interpret a chemical code.	Codes are
needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical
structures.  Clearly then, if the coding of chemical compounds
could be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion would
relieve the chemist of considerable burden.

Rapid Structure Searches via Permuted Chemical Line-Notations
.A
Sorter, P.F.
Granito, C.E.
Gilmer, J.C.
Gelberg, A.
Metcalf, E.A.
.W
  The Wiswesser chemical line-notation is an unique
and unambiguous method of representing chemical
structures by a linear series of letters, numbers,
ampersands, and hyphens.  These symbols are meaningful to
chemists familiar with the notation and can be processed
by automatic data processing (ADP) equipment. 
  The uniqueness of the line-notation permits the use
of alphanumerically arranged lists of notations for
dictionary-type searches.  This ordered arrangement
permits the rapid location of a specific compound or a
specific class of ring compounds other than benzenoid.

A Chemical Structure Storage and Search System Developed at Du Pont
.A
Gluck, D.J.
.W
  As early as 1961, we in the engineering Department of
Du Pont recognized the need for a better system for
recording chemical structure information for storage and
subsequent retrieval.  We believed that current methods
and the then current development of notation systems
would not completely serve our chemists' long range
chemical identification needs.
  Accordingly, we studied and then developed a chemical
structure storage and search system.  Huber gave a good
review of the various approaches and applications.  To use
his terminology, our system is topological coding.
  Our initial investigation led to singling out the following
needs for such a system.

The Generation of a Unique Machine Description for Chemical Structures -
A Technique Developed at Chemical Abstracts Service
.A
Morgan, H.L.
.W
  As part of the development of a computer-based
chemical information system at CAS, it has been necessary
to devise techniques for the registration of drawings of
chemical structures.  A major purpose of the CAS registration
process is to determine whether a particular structure has
already been stored in the system.  The ability to make
this determination makes it possible to utilize a computer
to assign to every chemical structure a unique identifying
label.  This identifying label, referred to as a registry
number, is the thread that ties together all information
associated with a particular compound throughout the
developing CAS computer system.  It is because of this 
association, made possible by the registration process, that
CAS will be able to provide multiple-file correlative searches
with assurance that all information on file for a particular
compound has been located.

Installation and Operation of a Registry for Chemical Compounds
.A
Leiter, D.P.
Morgan, H.L.
Stobaugh, R.E.
.W
  Since 1958 the Chemical Abstracts Service has been
working toward establishing a computer-based system for
handling chemical information.  Briefly, the concept of
the CAS system consists of sets of special subject files
in the following categories: (1) physical properties, (2)
chemical reactivities, (3) biochemical activities, and (4)
applications.  With the importance of compounds in
correlation studies, and the need to interrelate compounds
and the huge collections of chemical and other data, a
highly developed subsystem, called the Registry System,
for handling compounds must be the first step in the
actual operation of an over-all computer-based service.
The Registry System will include files of compounds 
interconnected with files of associated data that permit
identifying the compounds and retrieving them from the
files.

Atom-by-Atom Typewriter Input for Computerized
Storage and Retrieval of Chemical Structures
.A
Mullen, J.M.
.W
  Novel features have been added to a paper tape typewriter having a removable
typing element.  A symbol set has been devised which requires only nine 
characters for typing common chemical structures.  The typewriter has an uncoded
"INDEX" key which advances the paper without carriage return.  A companion key,
"BACK INDEX," was provided which directly retracts the paper.  Both have been
coded.  A tape record containing information sufficient for a computer to 
calculate an atom-bond connection table for a chemical structure is obtained
by typing the structure in any order solely from the keyboard or by use of the
reader with prepunched tapes containing frequently occurring substructures.
Cost was about one-fourth that of earlier paper tape chemical typewriters.

  ASCA (Automatic Subject Citation Alert) is a commercially available SDI
system covering the journal literature.  The repertoire of questions which
ASCA can utilize includes cited references, words from titles, authors,
organizations, etc., and allows for logical combinations of these questions.
This paper discusses differences and similarities between "citations" and
"words" in retrieving and disseminating information.  The problem of user-
system interaction is explored, and some techniques for developing effective
interest profiles are described.  Although ASCA is a multi-disciplinary system,
examples from fields like synthetic chemistry and biochemistry are provided.

Procedures for Converting Systematic Names of Organic

Rush, J.e.

  Simultaneously with its development of a computer-based Chemical Compound
Registry System, Chemical Abstracts Service is devising procedures for 
automatically converting systematic names of organic compounds into atom-
bound connection tables which can be manipulated by computer.  A study of
systematic Chemical Abstracts (CA) index names has resulted in a dictionary
of word roots used in the names and in step-by-step procedures for converting 
names to connection tables.  Statistical studies of nomenclature in CA indexes
show that these procedures are applicable not only to current nomenclature,
but also generally to names in past indexes.  Procedures have been written
which are applicable to the majority of names of carbon compounds, and the
preparation of computer programs is now under way.

A Chemical Notation and Code for Computer Manipulation
.A
Lefkovitz, D.
.W
  This paper describes and specifies the rules for generating a code to 
represent chemical formulas.  It may be used either as a notation or for 
internal manipulation by computer for registration, screening, and atom-by-
atom search.  It is basically a connection table in a concise format which also
contains abnormality information relating to specific atoms or relations 
between atoms.  The notation produced by these rules unambiguously defines
a structure (as a connection table), but the notation is unique only to a
given numbering (or citation order) of the atoms.  Hence, its uniqueness is
dependent on the numbering uniqueness of the atoms in the structural formula.
Techniques for the use of the code in registry and substructure search are
also discussed.

Conversion of Wiswesser Notation to a Connectivity Matrix for Organic Compounds
.A
Matthews, F.W.
Hyde, E.
Thomson, L.H.
Wiswesser, W.J.
.W
  A computer program is described which generates a connectivity matrix using
as input an unmodified Wiswesser notation.  This program records the topology
of a molecule as a statement of the atoms and their connectivity.  One symbol
is used to represent each atom and this symbol is descriptive of the atom and
its bonds.  The network of a complex molecule is recorded as a series of 
interruptions in an assumed linear path.  The application of this matrix to
information handling of chemical structures is described in a subsequent paper.

Ackermann, H.J.
Haglind, J.B.
Lindwall, H.F.
Maizell, R.E.
.W
  A unique method of computerized storage and retrieval of technical information
is applied in the SWIFT (Significant Word in Full Title) program.  SWIFT chooses
potential keywords from the titles, compares the key words with an exclusion 
word glossary to remove insignificant words and an internal glossary to prevent
duplication of terms.  The keywords may be either a full or fragmented term.
An option is available to index also by author.  Indexes, containing full 
citations, are printed periodically and cumulatively.  The magnetic tape file
is available for computer search through a sort and print program.  Responses
to inquiries conducted through the computer program are listed in full citation
format.

Substructure Search in the MCC System
.A
Lefkovitz, D.
.W
  A monitor system based upon computer-produced printed indexes is described in
this paper.  The system is intended to monitor a large scale experiment in file
organization for a real-time, interactive chemical information system.  It is
based upon a topological screen system that ensures the inclusion of every
compound atom (including H) in at least one screen assignment, that appears to
be responsive to a broad range of query types, and that is amenable to random-
access techniques.  The Monitor system is also considered, in this paper, as
an independent interim approach toward fulfilling, in an effective and economic
manner, the functional requirements of a small- to medium-sized chemical 
information system.  Thus it could be used to encode and generate structure
files, to assign search screens, and to provide manual substructure search
capability via microfilm or hard copy printed indexes.

New Developments in Primary Journal Publication
.A
Kuney, J.H.
.W
  The form and function of the journal as a medium
of communication between scientists, that is, one scientist
talking to another, have not changed greatly these past 100
years.	But during that time, the journal has evolved to a
highly effective medium for meeting the scientists' needs
for publication, distribution, storage, and retrieval of scientific
information.  Kessler describes the journal as the most
"successful and ubiquitous carrier of scientific information in
the entire history of science."  And the scientific paper, he
adds, "is such a marvelous and commodating invention that we
seem to take it for granted and forget that it has form and
structure that fit its function."

Index Chemicus Registry System:  Pragmatic Approach to
Substructure Chemical Retrieval
.A
Garfield, E.
Revesz, G.S.
Granito, C.E.
Dorr, H.A.
Calderon, M.M.
Warner, A.
.W
  The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS), launched in 1968 with the support
of a dozen industrial and governmental organizations, is now a current 
operational monthly service.  Subscribers receive magnetic tapes and printouts,
in which the weekly issues of Index Chemicus (IC) have been encoded in Wiswesser
Line Notations (WLN).  Over 13,000 compounds per month are provided in
machine language.  The canonical WLN is also provided in alphabetized printouts.
Encoding of over 400,000 new chemical compounds from IC has already been 
completed, including all those reported in 1967, 1968, and 1969.  Since the 
tapes also include title and other bibliographic information, this paper 
describes the use of supporting software provided for SDI search systems
employing "word" and other searching terms, in addition to the WLN fragments.
Use of the monthly and annual printouts are illustrated for those searches
which do not require computer manipulation.

The Multiterm Index:  A New Concept in Information Storage and Retrieval
.A
Skolnik, H.
.W
  An index not only can be a creative communication
medium, it needs to be in a research and development
environment.  A creative index is achievable if the
relationship and association of things and actions,
one to another, can be communicated as a continuous
function vis-a-vis the real world of science and
technology.
  A chemist does not think of a chemical, for example,
ethyl alcohol, in isolation.  Ethyl alcohol is not merely
a word or a term without dimensions to a chemist.  It
is a concept that he associates with or relates to a
product, a reactant, a solvent in a reaction, a use, a
property, etc.  It is within the semantics of his
conceptual needs that he would like to use an index to 
retrieve those documents he needs.  He wants more than
documents, however, from the index.  He wants the index
to direct him to those documents which are pertinent
to his problem.  He wants the index to help him to
generate thoughts and to suggest new combinations.
He wants the index to help him in terms of his language,
logic, and semantics and through a generic or specific 
approach, whichever occurs to him first.  He wants the
ability to browse among the terms to discover the term
that is on the tip of his tongue or recessed in his
memory.  These are the criteria an index must satisfy
if it is to be a creative medium of communication.

  A selected sample of 281 readers of the Journal of Organic Chemistry has been
interviewed personally to obtain data on their reading patterns of the November
1968 issue.  Approximately 35% of the individual subscribers to JOC had read
or looked through the journal within the first seven days of receipt.  The 
average reader claims to have read part or all of 14 articles out of the 81
available.  At least 75% of every one of the 81 articles was read, ranging
from a low of 0.7% to a high of 10.2%.  Structures or equations rated high as
a "noted" segment of an article.  In addition to data on amount of reading of
the issue, respondents were asked about amount of time spent reading, other
journals read, and journals subscribed to.  Correlations have been developed
between subject interest as stated by respondent and his actual reading pattern.

Design and Operation of a Computer Search Center for Chemical Information
.A
Williams, M.E.
Schipma, P.B.
.W
  The objective of the Computer Search Center (CSC) of the Information Sciences
section of IIT Research Institute (IITRI) is to provide a link between a wide
variety of users and the rapidly expanding information resources in machine-
readable form.  Because none of the available computer search programs met
the criteria of the center, and because of the need to handle a variety of data
bases, new general purpose computer programs were written, and a tape format
was developed so that a wide variety of data bases can be searched by the same
computer program.  The center was designed to provide current awareness and
retrospective search services from both document-type and data-type computerized
data files.  The desire to develop transferable programs for use at many
installations prompted the adoption of the machine-independent compiler 
language PL/1 and the use of IBM 360 series computers.  The objective of 
education and training led to the development of a "Search Manual" for profile
preparation, the development of a workbook in "Modern Techniques in Chemical
Information," the teaching of a new academic course, and the presentation of
seminars.

A Correlative Notation System for NMR Data
.A
Skolnik, Herman
.W
   A new linear notation system which denotes carbon in terms of bounds and 
attached hydrogen(s) is used to correlate proton groups in organic molecules
with chemical shifts.. The notation system is illustrated with acyclic and
cyclic examples, and the production of tables of NMR data via computer by 
proton group vis-a-vis neighboring groups is demonstrated.. Tables of chemical
shifts in ascending order is a valuable by-product of the computerized system..

Computer Generation of Wiswesser Line Notation
.A
Farrell, C.D.
Chauvenet, A.R.
Koniver, D.A.
.W
  Computer programs developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) produce
uncontracted though otherwise canonical Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN) for a  
fairly broad class of compounds.  An associated front end allows a chemist to
communicate with the programs by drawing structures on a Rand Tablet.  The
WLN generation programs accept connection table input, either from a previously
existing file or generated from the Rand Tablet drawing.  The programs recognize
situations which they cannot handle - the output is thus either correct WLN
or a message by which the programs acknowledge their limitations.  In general,
correct WLN will be produced for any compound containing not more than one
nonbenzene ring.  Work is under way to extend this to polycyclic fused ring 
systems.  The philosophy and concepts behind these programs are explained along
with the more interesting algorithmic results.  The role of the WLN-generation
programs in a developing NIH chemical information system is briefly discussed.
The WLN programs are written in Fortran IV and have been developed on a 
PDP-10 computer.

Koniver, D. A.
.W
   An interactive search and retrieval system for Weswesser Line Notation (WLN)
has been implemented.. The system employs bit screens, which are useful for 
filtering a file.. The user can graphically specify a search request structure
and immediately receive graphic information as the result of the search.. Four
Fortran IV programs were developed to prepare bit screens for WLN files, input 
the search request to generate the WLN, iteratively search the WLN bit screen 
file, and generate a two-dimensional representation of the chemical structure 
directly from the WLN..

   The computer program for the generation of Weswesser Line Notation (WLN) has
been extended to include polyfused rings, methyl contraction rules, chain of 
two ring systems, some perifused rings, some chelates, and some metallocences..
Salts and ions are also handled, but in a different manner than what is normally
found.. Multipliers are not used by the program.. The normal input for the WLN
generation is an easy input program using a Rand Tablet; however, teletype and 
connection table input can also be used in most cases..

Strategic Considerations in the Design of a Screening System for
Substructure Searches of Chemical Structure Files
.A
Adamson, G.W.

Lynch, M.F.
McLure, A.H.W.
Town, W.G.
Yapp, A.M.
.W
  A major problem in the design of screening systems for substructure searches
of chemical structure files is the development of a methodology for selection of
an optimal set of structural characteristics to act as screens.  The set chosen
for a particular application will depend on the characteristics of the
collection, as well as on its size and growth rate.  A strategy which takes
account of the disparate frequencies of the various species of fragments
in a data-base by use of differential, and, in part, hierarchical levels of
description is detailed.  The distributions of a variety of structural
characteristics, including bond-centered, atom-centered, and ring fragments
in a 30,000-compound sample of the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry System
are summarized.  Implementation of the approach, using primarily bond-centered
fragments, by means of simple and highly efficient computer programs, is
detailed.

Chemical Abstracts Index Names for Chemical Substances in the Ninth
Collective Period (1972-1976)
.A
Donaldson, N.
Powell, W.H.
Rowlett, R.J.
White, R.W.
Yorka, K.V.
.W
  Index names for chemical substances have been significantly revised by
Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) for Volume 76 [January-June 1972, the first
volume of the Ninth Collective Period (1972-1976)] and subsequent volumes of
Chemical Abstracts.  While remaining generally within the framework of IUPAC
and other existing nomenclature rules, the most systematic recommended names
have been chosen.  These names are more easily derived from molecular structural
diagrams, and, therefore, are more quickly found by index users.  Machine
editing of index names and translation of these names into structural
representations in the CAS computer-based information system are also aided
by the revisions.  The index name revisions include (i) conversion of almost all
"trivial" or author terminology into more systematic names, (ii) simplification
of general name-selection rules, and (iii) elimination of special treatment for
certain classes of substances.  Specific identifiable alloys, elementary
particles, enzymes, and mixtures of substances are now indexed like conventional
chemical substances.  Difficulties encountered with generation of previous
Chemical Abstracts index names and indexing rules are described, and comparisons
are made of new and former index names for chemical compounds and substituent
radicals.

The CA Integrated Subject File.  II. Evaluation of Alternative Data Base 
Organizations
.A
Zipperer, W.C.
Park, M.K.
Carmon, J.L.
.W
  The relative retrieval performances of the CA Integrated Subject File (CAISF),
CA Condensates, and a Merged File created from these two data bases have been
measured.  Retrieval performance is reported in terms of recall and precision
values as well as costs.  The precision and recall retrieval failures - i.e.,
irrelevant documents and missed documents - have been analyzed for each data
base and characterized according to the five major types of failures: index 
language, indexing, searching, clerical, and miscellaneous.  Over-all analysis
of the performance suggests that an effective data base can be created by
augmenting the CA Condensates data base with Registry Numbers and some
representation of the CAISF General Subject concept headings, which results
in a file approximately half the size of the corresponding CAISF data base
and is suitable for search using existing retrieval system software.

A Chemical Search System for a Small Computer
.A
Wilde, D.U.
Starke, A.C.
.W
  The mechanization of chemical information retrieval systems until now has been
limited to those organizations that have access to extensive computer 
facilities.  Now, small, low-cost computers, such as IBM's 1130 or DEC's PDP-11,
are available with input/output capacities that make them suitable for SDI
and retrospective searching  on any of the many commercially available data
bases.  Such a machine, located at the New England Research Application Center 
(NERAC), is described and the problems of using it for chemical information
retrieval are discussed.  NERAC's SDI Chemical Search System is described,
and an example profile is used to illustrate its capabilities.

Use of the IUPAC Notation in Computer Processing
of Information on Chemical Structures
.A
Dammers, H.F.
Polton, D.J.
.W
  A computer-operated storage and retrieval system for chemical structures
based on the use of the IUPAC notation has been in operation at Shell
Research Limited, Sittingbourne, Kent, England, since 1965, involving a
file of nearly 50,000 compounds.  Use of the IUPAC cipher has proved 
advantageous as regards speed and cost of both input and searching.  For
most searches, scanning of the information explicit in the cipher has proved
adequate.  Our computer programs also enable conversion of ciphers into atom-
connection tables and generation of fragmentation codes.  The integrated use
of these facilities and their merits relative to other approaches are discussed.

  Methods for retrieval of information on chemical compounds utilizing several
computer data bases have been compared to determine scope of data base coverage.
Queries for a single chemical, N-ethyl-@-methyl-m-trifluoromethylphenethylamine
(fenfluramine) and generic chemicals (2-pyrrolidinones) were submitted to the
services for searching through the recent literature.  Data bases employed
included MEDLARS, Excerpta Medica, CA Condensates, CBAC, Ringdoc, Current
Abstracts in Chemistry and Automatic New Structure Alert (ANSA).  Preparation
of search questions is outlined and comparative results are reported indicating
the yield from each data base.

A Graph-Theoretic Algorithm for Matching Chemical Structures
.A
Sussenguth, E.H., Jr.
.W
  There are many chemical retrieval systems which
process the first type of request efficiently.  Most of these
systems are also capable of handling certain fragment
requests; however, the fragments which can be processed
are frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, in
retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only
those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are
readily detected.  To allow a completely general 
specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a
detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query
and library structures.  A technique for making such detailed
comparisons is presented in this report.  This technique
is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad
restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching
procedures.
  Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm,
some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is
presented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flow
diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional
examples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for
a digital computer is discussed.
  This report is a condensed version of the original, which
gives a generalization and comprehensive description of
the algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics,
and applications other than chemical retrieval systems.

French National Policy for Chemical Information and the DARC System 
as a Potential Tool of This Policy
.A
Dubois, J. E.
.W
   The incentive and the main lines of French policy on chemical information, 
as well as their implementation, are described.. New governmental bodies have
been created aiming at seting up a national network for scientific and 
technical information.. Among these, the CNIC (Centre National d'Information 
Chemique) is in charge of the chemical field.. The DARC system is being 
implemented as a tool of national policy for chemical information.. An 
exhaustive chemical data processing system, it features topological encoding,
input, and retrieval methods which are described in this paper..

   A method has been developed for generating efficient screens for chemical
structures.. Fragments are generated by an algorithm under control of file
statistics.. The fragments obtained are normalized by weighting their code
patterns.. Superimposition of these codes yields the screen codes for the
structures..

The Chemical Abstracts Service Chemical Registry System.  I. General Design
.A
Dittmar, P.G.
Stobaugh, R.E.
Watson, C.E.
.W
  The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Chemical Registry System is a computer-
based system that uniquely identifies chemical substances on the basis of
composition and structure.  Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-alone
input, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organic
chemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increased
to include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has been
integrated into CAS indexing operations.  The third refinement of this system,
Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major
changes in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques
for registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms 
and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately 
identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each
substance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclature
derivation and also a computer-based structure output system.  The general
design of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic
segments, is presented.

  The introduction of Chemical titles in 1961 marked the

and other data-processing equipment.  The success of this
innovation has generated many requests for more information
about it.  With this in mind, we hope to encourage
other organizations to make use of this technique for
dissemination of information by presenting here a history

Technical-Abstracting Fundamentals.
II. Writing Principles and Practices
.A
Weil, B.H.
Zarember, I.
Owen, H.
.W
  Abstracts can serve their purpose best only if they are
carefully written to transmit important information to
readers quickly and accurately.  This requires knowledge
of audience needs, habits, and desires; ability to identify
the key facts in the document; ability to organize these
facts, to present them in the order best suited to the
audience; and ability to write the abstracts clearly,
concisely, and in conformity with the style rules of the
medium involved.  Some of these abilities are inborn, but
all can be learned by study, practice, and criticism.

Garfield, Eugene
.W
   The unique features  of the "references cited" in U.S. patents are discussed 
in relation to their  use in the patent section of the Science Citation Index, 
which adds a new dimension to patent searching.. Citation indexing provides a 
new basis for clarifying the concepts of similarity, coupling, novelty, and 
relevance..

Weighted Term Search: A Computer Program for an Inverted Coordinate Index
on Magnetic Tape
.A
Matthews, F. W.
.A
Thomson, L.
.W
   Ten to 15 years ago, much technical literature was accurately indexed 
according to strict rules of classification.. Today, because of the large
amount of technical data written, it is no longer practical to apply the same
rigid indexing procedures.. We should therefore be concerned with new search 
techniques which will allow us to handle input at the lower level we are forced 
to accept.. This paper describes such a search technique..

Articulation in the Generation of Subject Indexes by computer
.A
Armitage, J.E.
.W
  A simple and logical model for the automatic generation of subject indexes
from title like phrases is described, and its advantages and disadvantages
are discussed.	It is based on recent studies of the structure of articulated
subject indexes, such as those to Chemical Abstracts.  The model employs the
prepositions and connectives of phrases of simple structure as articulating
points, and selects from all possible forms of entries those which lead to
optimal organization in an index.  The technique is illustrated with part of an
index to a recent abstracting journal.  The wide variety of
controls which can be exerted by the indexer and the program is discussed.

Reading Behavior of Chemists
.A
Gushee, D.E.
.W
  Most discussions about the future design of chemical information systems
emphasize the effects of computer speed on composition, storage, searching,
and retrieval.  Little attention has been paid to the behavior of the
scientist (chemist) toward the learning process and the role of the literature
in that learning process.  The ACS has gained some insight into this behavior
and thus urges caution before one leaps to the uncritical conclusion that
the literature as now constituted is dead but has not yet fallen over.  What
seems more likely, when human behavior patterns are considered, is that the
new and the old will co-exist side by side for several generations, and that
the system's current emphasis on completeness will be replaced with selective
compression.

Critical Reviews: The User's Point of View
.A
Herring, C.
.W
Scientists are worried about the "information explosion" and the amount of
published literature that could have a significant impact on their work. One
thing that can help is a condensation and evaluation of the published material.
This is the task of reviews, and without them, the other tools for dealing with
the information explosion will be inadequate. Suggestions are made on ways for
authors and editors to make their reviews more eccessible and more useful and on 
the need for better education of users.

A Selective Current-Awareness System Using Engineering Index's
Plastics Data Base.  II. Performance
.A
Wagner, R.H.
.W
  The operational performance over a 17-month period of the previously
described selective dissemination system is presented.  Of the 21,000 
notifications sent to about 20 users, 91% were evaluated; of these, 14%
were of "Document-Ordered Interest," 48% were "Of Interest," 27% were
"Marginal," and 11% were "Of No Interest."  Recall data obtained from
about half the users over a period of eight months show the precision-
factor/recall-factor products are generally greater than 0.5.  The
effect of iterative profile adjustments on precision-recall performance
is discussed.  A comparison made with four other SDI systems shows a
relatively high level of performance for this system.

User Experiences with Primary Journals on 16-Mm Microfilm
.A
Starker, L.N.
.W
  The availability of scientific journals on 16-mm film is a relatively new
phenomenon.  User acceptance of this microfilm application has been greatly       
improved by loading the file into cartridges and making use of motor-driven
reader-printers.  This equipment permits rapid searching of the microfilm
and adds the convenience of on-the-spot hard-copy prints as needed.  Of prime  
importance are the economic advantages of these editions, since they allow many
special libraries to stretch greatly the space available to them for journal
housing.  The economics of this approach are also discussed, as are the 
reactions of the scientists and information personnel who use them.

Information Transfer Limitations of Titles of Chemical Documents
.A
Bottle, R.R.
Seeley, C.R.
.W
  Some methods of estimating the minimum amounts of information in a document
not retrievable through its title are discussed.  An analysis of the information
transferred by different types of keywords is helpful in planning search
strategies, e.g., 30% of chemical substances mentioned in journal articles
are not discernable in their titles even when broad class names are used
as synonyms.  Patents have considerably less informative titles than journal
articles.  In nuclear science, report titles are also less informative than 
those of journal articles, but the proportion of reports with completely 
uninformative titles is now only 10% of the 1957 value.  Titles in chemistry
are more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alerting
and other services based on titles requires a good understanding of the
underlying information transfer principles.

The Development, Cost, and Impact of a Current Awareness Service in an
Industrial Town
.A
Bowman, C.M.
Brown, M.T.
.W
  The development of a current awareness system in The Dow Chemical Company 
has resulted in four established services, one based on internal information and
the other three on Chemical Abstracts.  In addition several other services are 
now being tried or considered.  The operation of such a service is expensive, 
but the willingness of the user to pay for it and responses to a survey indicate
that it is a useful and worthwhile tool to the scientist and engineer.  The
use of such services also has a significant effect on other established
information services.

Document Access
.A
Weil, B.H.
.W
  Long-range, copies of needed documents will be rapidly and inexpensively
supplied to users in libraries or at their desks by querying an electronic
network linking document sources (central libraries and publishers).  In the
interim, local libraries will slowly progress through increased dependence
on local holdings of microfilm to development of and dependence on regional,
national, and discipline networks for access to most of the documents desired.
These developments will depend, however, on resolution of the copyright problem
by mechanisms that will fairly remunerate the copyright owners.  As background,
and because radical change is not expected overnight, the paper also reviews
conventional and sophisticated storage systems, including microfilm, facsimile,
and video; copyright aspects; costs; need for speed; other user considerations;
and standards.

An Inquiry on New Forms of Primary Publications
.A
Moore, J.A.
.W
  Some of the problems associated with present journal publications practices 
are discussed.  These are attributed to the fact that as the literature has
expanded, the needs of both authors and readers are no longer being met by
printing and distributing all of the material accepted to all subscribers.
A two-edition system is proposed, with short versions of papers in a broad
circulation issue and expanded versions, including full details and discussion, 
in library-circulation microfilm editions.  Reactions of chemists to such
a system are discussed.  It is recommended that two-edition journals be
developed in a evolutionary way by increasing use of the ACS mcirofilm 
editions for sections of articles and for supplementary documents to accompany
communications.

Evaluation of the Database CA Condensates Compared with Chemical Titles
.A
Hansen, Inge Berg
.W
   The performance of CA Condensates and Chemical Titles based on analysis of
precision and "relative recall CT/CC" for a collection of 46 search profiles 
was studied over a period of one year.. Special emphasis was laid on the 
function of the keyword phrases of CC and the users' attitude towards 
literature categories not represented in CT.. The results are discussed in 
terms of the value of the systems for Danish users seen from users' and the 
documentalist's point of view..

User Assessment of Computer-Based Bibliographic Retrieval Services
.A
Carmon, J.L.
Park, M.K.
.W
  The academic users of the bibliographic information dissemination center
were surveyed to determine the ways in which the search results were being
used, the impact which the services had had on professional activities such
as research and instruction, the interface between the computer-based
retrieval and the traditional form of library resources, and the effect of
document overlap between different data bases.  The survey results indicate
that the dissemination services are being used by a large portion of the
faculty and the graduate students within the University System of Georgia,
with an average of 3 to 5 people seeing the bibliography from each search
question.  Over 97% of the respondees indicated some or substantial
contribution to their professional activities, with the major contributions 
being a savings or more efficient use of time and broadened subject
coverage.  The users indicated several changes in library use habits as a
result of the computer-based searches, among them more direct access to the
primary literature and increased use of library resources as they had been
made aware of new sources and media - e.g., microforms.  Percentage
responses on these and related topics are presented.

An Indexing Coverage Study of Toxicological Literature
.A
Montgomery, R.R.
.W
  A data base of 1873 citations dated 1960-1969 was obtained through an 
author survey of the members of the Society of Toxicology.  Coverage was
determined by checking the author index through a maximum of three years
after publication or through the end of the decade.  Chemical Abstracts
consistently provided coverage of more than two-thirds of the 1960-1967
citations in the data base.  Chemical Abstracts, Biological Abstracts,
Index Medicus, and Science Citation Index each provided coverage of 79%
to 85% of the 215 citations dated 1966 and their combined coverage exceeded
98%.  Excerpta Medica (Section IIC) and Chemical-Biological Activities
provided 43% and 58% coverage, respectively, of this same group of 215
citations.

Evaluation of an SDI Service Based on the Index Chemicus Registry System
.A
Leggate, P.
Rossiter, B.N.
Rowland, J.F.B.
.W
  The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS) is the
machine-readable equivalent of Current Abstracts in
Chemistry & Index Chemicus (CAC & IC).  In an earlier
paper, we described the development of an experimental
selective-dissemination-of-information (SDI) service
based on these tapes.  A detailed description of the
techniques of profile construction for searching a
Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN) structure file is given in
this earlier paper.  The present paper describes the evaluation
of the SDI service in terms both of quantitative measures
of retrieval performance, coverage and currency, and also of
user reactions to the service, as expressed in their replies
to a questionnaire.  Failure analysis techniques were used to
identify the reasons for retrieval failures and possible
methods for improving retrieval performance.  A fuller
description of the evaluation has been published in report
form.

Profiling, the Key to Successful Information retrieval
.A
O'Dononue, C. H.
.W
   A major tool employed to enter an information source is the search profile..
The development of an adequate profile depends upon the aids supplied by the 
data bases.. These aids vary in their content and depth and their proper use is
essential for relevant information retrieval.. The data bases examined are CA 
Condensates, Index Medicus, and BA data bases.. Several searches are presented
with a study of their comparative profiles..

Journals Most Cited by Chemists and Chemical Engineers
.A
Barrett, R.L.
Barrett, M.A.
.W
  The purpose of this paper is to present up-to-date
material to indicate some of the changes that have taken
place during and since World War II.  For purposes of
comparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard is
represented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2.  The
results of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4.
The reader can draw several obvious conclusions.  About
half of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to papers
published in the 1950's.  This, in part, reflects the
present highly vigorous state of chemical investigation
and its rapid expansion in recent years.  Another striking
fact is that in the Journal of the American Chemical
Society, 39.5% of the citations are to previous work
published in the journal itself.  In Industrial and
Engineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citations
is 21.3.  To some extent this may result from the fact
that writers who habitually publish in a particular
journal tend to cite their own work.  However, it seems
to reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these
journals in their respective fields.  More than 38%
of the citations in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry
are to various American Chemical Society publications.
In the Journal of the American Chemical Society more than

Overview of the NAS/NRC Conference on Large Data Bases
.A
Williams, M.E.
.W
  In 1971 the Committee on Chemical Information of the
National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council,
recognized the problem of large data bases and accordingly
created a subcommittee to investigate the problem and its
impact on chemical information.
  The first task of the Large Data Base Subcommittee was
to survey organizations that generate and/or process large
data bases.  Giering has indicated several different ways in
which one can view a data base as being large.  It can be
large in terms of having a large number of entries or
records (or bibliographic references).  It can be large in
the sense of having a large number of fields or data
elements, which implies a degree of complexity.  It can be
thought of as large in the sense of having a large number
of searchable or selectable elements, and it also can be
large in the most readily understandable sense of having
a large number of characters in storage.

The Large Data Base File Structure Dilemma
.A
Lefkovitz, D.
.W
  This paper first presents a brief tutorial on the principal random file
organization methods for handling two major applications - Transaction
oriented systems and Information storage and retrieval systems.  It then
addresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorily
resolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under active
investigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One is
called the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old technique
called super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and has 
recently been installed in an operational system.  Some statistics related
to file characteristics in this application are provided, but operational
cost and performance statistics are not yet available.

Substructure Searching of Computer-Readable Chemical Abstracts
Service Ninth Collective Index Nomenclature Files
.A
Fisanick, W.
Mitchell, L.D.
Scott, J.A.
Vander Stouw, G.G.
.W
  The increasing availability of computer-readable files of chemical  
nomenclature and of programs for text searching has led to the development
of methods for performing substructure searches in which CA nomenclature
terms are used as search terms.  Substructure searches on CA Index
nomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topological
searches, as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety of
searches.  Many data bases which contain CA Index nomenclature also contain
nonsubstance data.  Thus, searching of substance and nonsubstance data
can often be done within a single search of a file with both high recall
and relevancy.  Profile construction aids prepared by CAS make it possible
for persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to construct
nomenclature profiles for many questions.

Searching CA Condensates On-Line vs. the CA Keyword Indexes
.A
Michaels, C. J.
.W
   A study was conducted to compare the comprehensiveness of searches performed
using Systems Development Corporation's (SDC) Chemcon data base and keyword 
indexes of Chemical Abstracts.. It was concluded that, in most cases, a 
computer search yielded at least as many relevant references as did a manual 
search.. However, in the case of very general search questions, results from 
manual searches were much more satisfactory..

Searching Chemical Abstracts vs. CA Condensates
.A
Buntrock, Robert E.
.W
   As of March 1975, as much as four and one-half years of Chemical Abstracts
Indexes and on-line accessible Chemical Abstracts Condensates can be compared..
Although combined searches of both data bases are the most effective, examples
are shown in which it is more practical and efficient to search CA Condensates..
CHEMCON and CHEM7071, the on-line versions of CA Condensates loaded at System
Development Corp. (SDC), are compared with CA Indexes..

Searching the Chemical Abstracts Condensates Data Base 
via Two On-Line Systems

Prewitt, Barbara G.
.W
   A comparison of the most used features of System Development Corporation's
ORBIT and Lockheed's DIALOG systems is made, especially in reference to 
conducting  searchers of Chemical Abstracts Condensates..Many of the operations
are similar in nature.. However the capabilities are sufficiently  different 
that an experienced searcher can select the system which gives the best 
results..

A Survey of the Use of On-Line Computer-Based Scientific Search Services
by Academic Libraries
.A
Marshall, Doris B.
.W
   To explore their use of on-line computer-based bibliographic search services,
a one-page questionnaire was sent to 100 academic libraries in the United 
States having separate departmental chemistry or science libraries.. An attempt
was made to determine the background training of the persons performing the
searches, who the end users were, the growth trend, the funding, the data
bases used, and the value to the users.. Of the 73 replies, 49.3% indicated use
of such services, while 24.6% were planning to use them primarily by faculty
and graduate students.. Of those reporting, 83.3% used searchers with a 
background in library or information science; 47.2% had a background in 
scientific discipline..Two or more on-line services were used by 72.2%.. A 
majority of respondents stated that the use paid all expenses or a portion of 
the expenses.. The searches met the needs of the use most of the time in 83.3% 
of the cases, and all of the time in 5.4%..

Semiconductor Journals

Hawkins, Donald T.
.W
   Using an on-line literature searching system, the number of papers in many 
journals dealing with semiconductors was determined.. The journals are ranked 
by the percentage of their contents devoted to semiconductors, and by the total
number of semiconductors papers are published.. Only four journals devote over
half of their contents to semiconductors papers.. Approximately half of the
19,646 papers (which were found in 91 journals) appeared in eight journals..

A Fuzzy-Set-Theoretic Interpretation of Linguistic Hedges
.A
Zadeh, L. A.
.W
   A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very, 
more or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operator 
which acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. For
example, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts
on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man..
   To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several
elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may
be built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate 
representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as 
complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast
intensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc..
   Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, 
e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated
by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, 
e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is 
more  complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components 
of its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge 
requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its 
operand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it
falls into category I or II..
   The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for 
several relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly,
etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, 
require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more 
qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper..

Subject Indexes and Automatic Document Retrieval
.A
Lynch, Michael F.
.W
   Index entries from the subject indexes to CA can, in general, be converted
to 'normal' or title-like phrases by applying simple tests to the positions of
prepositions and conjunctions in the entries.. Other, more complex, entries can
be transformed after somewhat deeper analysis.. These manipulations are a 
necessary preliminary step to the use of the subject-index language in 
retrieval..A scheme is outlined for automatically compiling and editing subject 
indexes by transforming descriptive phrases with regular structure and 
vocabulary.. These transformations, based on the formal structure of language, 
are shown to be admirably suited to computer manipulation..

The Law of Constant Citation for Scientific Literature
.A
Gomperts, M. C.
.W
   In listing the literature concerning the subject of 'vibrating plates' the
following law was noticed:
            Rj x aj,t = constant = 5x6
where Rj is the 'citation factor' for the year, j, and aj,t stands for the 
total number of articles that have appeared up to and including year j..
   'This 'citation law' is based on the remarkable fact that in more than 150
years the mean number of relevant citations per article per year has remained
constant, viz. 2x8, in spite of the fact that after 1950 three times as many
articles have been published as in the period before 1950..

The Derivation and Application of the Bradford-Zipf Distribution
.A
Brookes, B. C.
.W
   Any statistical regularities found in documentation should be fully 
exploited to produce estimates or predictions and to save documentalists work..
But present formulations of the Bradford distribution demand penetrating search
for peripheral papers and tedious computation in application.. The present 
paper shows that the Bradford distribution is closely related to the Zipf
distribution.. It requires data on only the most productive journals, is
mathematically simple and amenable to graphical methods if a proposed idea of
the 'completeness' of a search is accepted.. For comparability of results, 
certain conditions, which include a specified minimum level of productivity of 
journals, need to be standardized.. A standard form is suggested..
   It is found, however, that a modified form of the Bradford distribution is 
required when Bradford-type collections of journals are merged into large
collections, when 'saturation' of the most productive journals occurs..

Statistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics?
.A
Pritchard, A.
.W
  The term statistical bibliography seems to have been first used by E.
Wyndham Hulme in 1922 when he delivered two lectures as the Sandars Reader
in bibliography at the University of Cambridge.  Subsequently the lectures
were published as a book.  Although the debt has never been explicitly
recognized by means of citations, Hulme anticipated modern work on the
history of science.  He used the term to mean the illumination of the
processes of science and technology by means of counting documents.  Hulme
both summarized the results of Cole and Eales and produced original work
on the growth of UK patents (relating these to social progress in the
UK) and on the changes displayed in the International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature (relating changes in subject and country production
of literature to international developments).

The Effect of Growth on the Obsolescence of Semiconductor 
Physics Literature
.A
Oliver, Merrill R.
.W
   Semiconductor physics literature is studied in order to investigate recent
hypotheses relating obsolescence to the growth in periodical literature and the
growth in the number of contributing scientists.. The results indicate that
obsolescence remains constant and that the two growth rates are, within
experimental error, of equal magnitude for this subject over a five-year 
period.. These results are seen to be inconsistent with the assumption that an
exponentially-growing literature possesses a constant utility..

The Ambiguity of Bradford's Law
.A
Wilkinson, Elizabeth A.
.W
   Recent discussion of Bradford's law of scatter has been founded on two
formulations that are not mathematically equivalent.. A method of comparing the
two formulations against empirical data is developed, and the results using
four sets of existing data are discussed.. The results show that one particular
formulation is more consistent with the practical situation..

On the Inverse Relationship of Recall and Precision
.A
Cleverdon, C.W.
.W
  It is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presented
which appeared to support the hypothesis that there was an inverse
relationship between recall and precision. The idea of this was certainly not
new; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA and
ABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not-
Only (high recall).  However, it was one of the propositions arising from
Cranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked.
In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the
simple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test results
coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made
further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward
to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of
subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected
decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question,
there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results
of a number of different searches are averaged.  This, it will be noted, has
four qualifications to the basic statement.

A Test for the Separation of Relevant and Non-Relevant Documents 
in Experimental Retrieval Collections
.A
Van Rijsbergen, C. J.
.A
Jones, Sparck K.
.W
   Many retrieval experiments are intended to discover ways of improving 
performance, taking the results obtained with some particular technique as a 
baseline.. The fact that substantial alterations to a system often have little 
or no effect on particular collections is puzzling.. This may be due to the 
initially poor separation of relevant and non-relevant documents.. The paper 
presents a procedure for characterizing this separation for the collection, 
which can be used to show whether proposed modifications of the base system are 
likely to be useful..

  This paper examines the implications of the findings of evaluative tests
regarding the retrieval performance of natural language in various subject
fields.  It suggests parallel investigations into the structure of natural
language, with particular reference to terminology, as used in the different
branches of basic science.  The criteria for defining the terminological
consistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested for
determining the degree of terminological consistency.
  The terminological and information structures of specific disciplines such
as, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, and geology; the circumstances in
which terms originate; and the efforts made by the international scientific
community to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines -
are examined in detail.  This investigation shows why and how an artificially
created scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with current
developments and thus points to the source of natural language.

Optimization of Library Expenditure on Biochemical Journals
.A
Line, M.B.
.W
  In a 1973 paper, Sengupta analysed references to biochemical journals in an
attempt to provide a guide for librarians with a limited budget.  He not only
ranked journals by the absolute number of citations made to 1969 volumes, but
related the number of citations to the number of papers and even to the number
of words in each journal, as perhaps 'a better guide to selection of journals 
for subscription than position in the ranking list.'  (A similar procedure is 
adopted in two more recent articles by Sengupta on physiology and microbiology
journals.)

Citation Analyses as Indicators of the Use of Serials: A Comparison of 
Ranked Title Lists Produced by Citation Counting and from Use Data
.A
Scales, Pauline A.
.W
   Lists of journals ranked according to number of citations received are 
frequently used as indicators of usefulness, but little research has been 
carried out to test the validity of this hypothesis.. On comparing lists of 
titles of journals ranked by citation counting with lists of the same journals, 
ranked according to frequency of use (using data from a survey at the National 
Lending Library), it was found that the rank order correlation between the two 
was low.. This suggestions that ranked lists produced by analyses of citations 
do not constitute valid guides for journal selection by libraries..

A Scientific Theory of Classification and Indexing 
and Its Practical Application
.A
Farradane, J. E. L.
.W
   A classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge.. From a 
discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the 
only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from 
empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification..
Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates,
and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four
basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and
causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a
linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations
of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of 
the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given,
and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be
constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form..
The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an
inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the
structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique
for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with
complete flexibility..

A New Look at Reference Scattering
.A
Cole, P.F.
.W
  It was first observed by Bradford that, for a large collection of journal
references on a given subject, most of the articles are derived from a small
proportion of the total titles.  Bradford listed the journals concerned in order
of decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative
totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced,
he obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many later
workers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distribution
of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of
literature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these results
Bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference
scattering.  Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predicted
not a straight line but a curve.  Kendall has now provided a more refined
statistical explanation of the straight line observed by Bradford.

The Foreign-Language Problem Facing Scientists and Technologists 
in the United Kingdom - Report of a Recent Survey
.A
Wood, D. N.
.W
   The foreign-language barrier facing British scientists is a function of a,
the amount and value of foreign scientific literature produced; b, the 
linguistic ability of the people wishing to read it; and c, the availability
and effectiveness of translation services.. To obtain quantitative data on 
these points the NLL has recently conducted a survey amongst scientists and
librarians in the United Kingdom and the present paper presents the more
important results..
   The survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitude
and is common to the majority of scientists and technologists.. The languages
creating the most difficulty are Russian, German, and Japanese.. It has also 
indicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and 
that, as far as national facilities are concerned, British scientists are 
largely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their 
difficulties..
   The results of the investigation suggest a number of lines of action which 
the appropriate authorities might follow..  The most important would seem to be
the publishing of a international index to translations and the creation within 
the United Kingdom of a centralized Japanese translation service..

Minimum Vocabularies in Information Indexing
.A
Moss, R.
.W
   Words have no precision, though in information storage and retrieval we are
required to act as if they did.. We have, therefore, to impose certain 
arbitrary conditions to reduce the element of personal interpretation..
'Meaning' must be remove from the indexing stage to that of vocabulary 
construction.. Vocabularies can be reduced to a minimum, first to a core of 
terms used in specialist science, and, following Russel, ultimately to
undefined terms symbolic of sense experience.. 'Basic English' has shown 
similar minimizing to be feasible for a natural language.. The success of
Batten cards shown that the principle could be equally applicable to specialist 
indexing vocabularies..

Opening the Black Box of 'Relevance'
.A
Cuarda, Carlos A.
.A
Katter, Robert V.
.W
   The purpose of this project was to identify variables thought to affect 
relevance judgements and conduct a series of laboratory studies to determine
the effects of these variables on relevance judgements.. This paper discusses
the variable of 'implicit use orientations' - the particular attitude taken by
a subject (judge) about the intended use of a document.. One hundred and forty
judges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information 
requirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each 
adopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. It
was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked 
effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use 
orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that
their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which
one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of 
another..
   Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to
evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system.. This judgements
have usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to 
critical scrutiny.. There is reason to believe, however, that as ordinarily
obtained, they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions of
measurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluation
studies..

Progress in Documentation
.A
Line, M.B.
Sandison, A.
.W
  The term 'obsolescence' occurs frequently in the literature of librarianship
and information science.  In numerous papers we are told how most published
literature becomes obsolete within a measurable time, and that an item receives
half the uses it will ever receive ('half-life') in a few years.  'Obsolescence'
is however very rarely defined, and its validity, interest, and practical value
are often assumed rather than explained.  Before reviewing studies on
'obsolescence', therefore, it is necessary to look at the concept and to
identify the reasons why it should be of interest.

  These authors collected a large number of references to a certain subject,

decreasing productivity.  Thus for applied geophysics they found (loc. cit.,
p. 112) 1 periodical containing 93 references, 1 containing 86, 4 containing
16, 49 containing 2, and 169 containing only 1 reference.  They then made
cumulative totals for the two sets of figures, so that in the T most productive
periodicals there occurred in all R references.  Bradford then plotted log T
against R and his curves are reproduced as B and C in Fig. 1.  An exactly
similar procedure for periodical references borrowed by Butterwick resulted
in curve A.  In both A and B, after an initial steep rise (up to about R = 500),
the curves approximate to a straight line, R = a log T + b.

A National Loan Policy for Scientific Serials
.A
Urquhart, D.J.
Bunn, R.M.
.W
  Elsewhere (1) a survey has been reported of the use of the serials in the
Science Museum Library.  In brief this showed that where the Science
Museum Library's copy of a serial was frequently used, this serial was widely
held, and that the converse was true.  In fact it appears that the use of the
Science Museum's copy of a periodical is a rough measure of the national
loan use of library copies.

Journal Usage Versus Age of Journal
.A
Cole, P.F.
.W
  The effective planning of technical libraries would be greatly facilitated
if there were some theoretical basis which could be used to predict the
probable distribution by titles, and by age of journal, of future journal
demand.  As a first step, the author has recently developed a general expression
for the distribution among journal titles of large groups of journal references.
In this present paper a relationship between usage and age of journal
is established and the application of this relationship to some library planning
problems is illustrated.

Student Attitudes to the University Library.  A Survey at Southampton University
.A
Line, M.B.
.W
  A good deal is now known about the use made by students of university
libraries, notably from the surveys carried out by Leeds University
Library in 1957 and 1960.  Statistics of use, however, will not by themselves
indicate how good a library is, whether as a bookstock, a building, or
an administrative department.  How adequate is the bookstock?  How fully
is it being exploited?  How important are physical and personal elements?
These are questions librarians are continually asking themselves, but they
are also questions readers could be asked directly or indirectly.

Keywords and Clumps
.A
Needham, R.M.
Jones, K.S.
.W
  Recent work at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has been
concerned with the development of automatic classification procedures for
information retrieval.  This has taken the form of research into methods of
classification of keywords extracted from documents, with a view to using
the classes found for co-ordinate indexing of technical material.  We cannot
claim to have solved this problem because the methods we have been able 
to develop so far cannot be applied on a sufficiently large scale.  We have,
however, made enough progress to make us feel that this a fruitful line of
research.

Tests on Abstracts Journals
.A
Martyn, J.
Slater, M.
.W
  The amount of scientific and technical information published 
annually in the form of journal articles, conference papers, reports, theses,
patents, and books now greatly exceeds, in every field of interest, the
amount which may be scanned by a scientist wishing to keep himself completely
up to date in his own subject.  For a scientist wishing to inform himself of
new developments in neighbouring subject-fields the problem is
even greater.  Consequently, either the scientist reconciles himself to the
knowledge that he is not aware of all relevant information in his field or
he places increasingly more reliance on such bibliographic tools as are
available to guide him towards the relevant literature.
  First among such tools is the abstracts journal.

Survey of Information Needs of Physicists and Chemists
.A
Aims, A.
.W
  Scientific research is expensive and the practical application of its
results is even more expensive.  Information services are relatively
inexpensive and, by constantly improving their scope and efficiency and
encouraging the scientist to make the best use of them, we can minimize
duplication and inefficiency in research and development.  This is the
justification for the present survey and for all the work on user needs
which has preceded it.

Information Use Studies 
Part 2 - Comparison of Some Recent Surveys
.A
Barnes, R.C.M.
.W
  Information-use studies are vitally necessary in order to complement,
challenge, and sharpen informed intuitive judgements, but even the
broadest conclusions drawn from such studies need to be examined critically.
The conclusions or their generality may sometimes be invalidated by special
conditions in the survey sample, by the environment having been disturbed 
by the survey, by the interpretation given to questions or observations, or
by the way the data has been analyzed.	These same factors make direct
comparison of results from different surveys difficult, and make superficial
comparisons misleading.  Some comparisons and conclusions are certainly much
less sound than the casual reader might suppose, particularly when results
have been compressed and taken out of their context in the original survey.
The difficulty of comparing information-use surveys is well illustrated by
the copious footnotes used by Menzel, Lieberman, and Dulchin in order to
qualify the significance of the results which they compare.

A Computer_Aided Information Service for Nuclear Science and Technology
.A
Rolling, Loll N.
.W
   The computerized information centre of the European Atomic Energy Community
has become operational.. A survey of its principal characteristics is given, and
the main problems that arose in the development phase of the system are 
discussed.. The Euratom Thesaurus includes graphic representation of 
relationships between indexing terms.. A dual vocabulary allows specific 
indexing for high relevance and generic indexing for high recall.. Retrieval 
strategy involves utilization of Boolean operators and frequency-of-occurrence 
tables.. Recall ration can be determined graphically by a continuous approach 
method.. Indexing consistency tests show that it pays to use subject 
specialists.. User's needs are discussed in terms of subject coverage, 
specificity, rapidity, and presentation.. The user service comprises 
retrospective searches on request as well as customer profile service on 
subscription.. There are three types of relevance, and various ways of bringing
system relevance to coincide with user relevance.. The Centre's budgetary 
requirements are low, due to circumspect use of its computer, an IBM 360, model
40.. Its aims are centralization of documentation in the nuclear field and
international co-operation..

Student Attitudes to the University Library:
A Second Survey at Southampton University
.A
Line, Maurice B.
.A
Tidmarsh, Mavis
.W
   In May 1965 a survey into student attitudes to the Library of Southampton
University was carried out by questionnaire with a sample of 322 
undergraduates.. The aim was to assess the effect, if any, of the considerable 
measures taken since the 1962 survey.. Uncontrolled factors, mainly related to
the rapid expansion of the University, may. however, have effected the results..
It appears that, except for social science students, there were few improvements
in attitudes and use, and that seminars had little measurable effect.. Possible 
explanations for this are offered, and the place of reader services in a 
university library discussed.. Other items covered by the survey include the use
of libraries in Halls of resinence and of Southampton Public Libraries, which in 
both cases showed a sharp decline since 1962, the number and cost of books 
bought by undergraduates, and their use of libraries in vacations..

The Citation Characteristics of Astronomical Research Literature
.A
Meadows, A. J.
.W
   The citation characteristic of papers in the Monthly Notices of the Royal
Astronomical Society (especially for the years 1963-5) have been examined as a 
means of studying the usage of astronomical literature in the United Kingdom..
The decrease of usage with age has been investigated and the decay half-life 
determined.. Particular attention has been paid to the immediacy affect, and
to its possible variation in different sub-fields of astronomy.. The citations
have also been separated according to journal of origin.. As a result of this 
study, a quantitative estimate has been made of the titles and backruns that are
required to satisfy a given percentage of the demand for astronomical research
literature in the country..

Tests on Abstracts Journals:  Coverage Overlap and Indexing
.A
Martyn, J.
.W
   In a previous paper (J. Doc. 20 (4) 1964, 212-35) a series of tests on
the coverage, overlap, and indexing of abstracts journals were described.
Briefly, these were carried out by selecting recent, comprehensive
bibliographies on specific subjects, searching the appropriate abstracts
journals via the author indexes to determine the number of references given
in the bibliography that were abstracted, then consulting the subject
indexes to try to locate those references which are known to have been 
abstracted.  A further eight bibliographies have been studied, and the
results are reported here.
   Our results are presented below in the following form:
1. Title of bibliography, source, content (number of journal references,
   reports, etc.).
2. Abstracts journals consulted.
3. Coverage and multiple coverage.  This is a bar-chart showing number of
   references not abstracted, those covered once, twice, and so on.
4. Coverage by each abstracts journal, given as a bar-chart, the last column
   showing coverage by all services combined.  (Where bar-charts are given
   they show coverages as percentages of the whole bibliography, actual
   numbers of references being shown beneath the appropriate columns.
5. Taking each abstracts journal separately, we show the headings under
   which references were found in the subject index.  Some references we
   were unable to locate, so there is often an apparent discrepancy with the
   figures given in 4.

The Bradford Distribution
.A
Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F.
.W
   The distribution of references in a collection of pertinent source documents
can be described and predicted by the relation F(x) = ln(1 + bx)/ln(1 + b) where
the parameter b is related to the subject field and the completeness of the
collection.. The model is used to predict the reference yield of abstracting
journals in a search for thermophysical property data.. It is used also to 
explain differences among various literature studies of the past in terms of
differences in subject and comprehensiveness of search.. The model is derived 
from S.C. Bradford's 'law of scattering' and is called the Bradford 
Distribution..

Evaluating the Economic Efficiency of a Document Retrieval System
.A
Lancaster, F. W.
.A
Climenson, W. D.
.W
   A retrieval system may be evaluated strictly in terms of user satisfaction
(operating efficiency), or it may be evaluated from the point of view of
efficient means of satisfying user requirements (economic efficiency).. When
we consider the relationship between operating efficiency and economic 
efficiency, we are faced with a whole series of possible trade-offs.. There
may be several alternative paths we can follow in order to serve user needs..
The problem is to determine the most economical path to follow.. Pay-off
factors, break-even points, and diminishing returns must be taken into 
consideration.. This paper considers some of these factors in relation to various
parts of the complete retrieval system: the acquisition subsystem, the indexing 
subsystem, the index language, the searching subsystem, and the equipment 
subsystem..

The Measures of Information Retrieval Effectiveness proposed by Swets
.A
Brookes, B. C.
.W
   Objective comparisons of the effectiveness of IR techniques are needed for
development of IR systems.. The measures proposed by Swets, which offer 
important advantages, are analyzed and critically discussed.. Modifications of 
the Swets measures, designed to increase their generality and to facilitate 
their interpretation in terms of system variables, are proposed..

A Study of Cross-Referencing
.A
Kochen, Manfred
.A
Tagliacozzo, Renata
.W
   The problem of determining the optimal cross-reference structure for a given 
index and for a given community of users is discussed.. A ross-reference 
structure is represented as a graph in which the nodes are index terms and the 
links are relations between index terms.. In order to clarify the concept of 
'level of cross-referencing' the characteristics of cross-referencing structure
are studied.. Some measures of cross-reference distributions are suggested as a
means of comparing the cross-referencing levels of subject indexes..
   Types of relations linking the terms of cross-references in existing indexes
and thesauri are examined.. The implications of the study for the construction
and testing on indexes and thesauri are discussed..

Statistics of Scientific and Technical Articles
.A
Vickery, B.C.
.W
  A new estimate of the number of currently published scientific and
technical periodicals has been put forward by K.P. Barr of the National
Lending Library.  It may be of interest to supplement this with some figures
on the number and distribution of articles within these periodicals.  These
figures are derived from a survey undertaken at the NLL early in 1964.

Documentation Notes
.A
Cawkell, A.E.
.W
  I would suggest three possible reasons for the constant average number of
references per article.  Firstly, on average, articles more than fifteen years
old rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance.  The
net increase per annum of 'citeable articles' is not as large as might otherwise
be expected.
  Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending to
have its own literature and 'internal' citation practices, are hiving off from
the classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science.
  Thirdly it seems that the 'building blocks' of an article can on average
be adequately specified (regardless of the volume of published information)
by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the main
theme, associated concepts and methods, and general background.

The Parametric Description of Retrieval Tests
Part I: The Basic Parameters
.A
Robertson, S.E.
.W
   Some parameters and techniques in use for describing the results of tests 
on IR systems are analysed.. Several considerations outside the score of the 
usual 2x2 table are relevant to the choice of parameters.. In particular, a
variable which produces a 'performance curve' of a system corresponds to an
extension of the 2x2 table.. Also, the statistical relationships between
parameters are all-important.. It is considered that precision is not such a
useful measure of performance (in conjunction with recall) as fallout.. A more
powerful alternative to Cleverdon's 'inevitable inverse relationship between
recall and precision' is proposed and justified, namely that the recall-fallout
graph is convex..

Documentation Notes
.A
Zipf, Library
.W
   A recent article by Kozachkov and Khursin, entitled 'The basic probability
distribution in information flow systems', describes the fundamental similarity
of a number of known statistical regularities in the flow of information.. They
propose a basic model, called the 'hyperbolic ladder' and relate it, in 
particular, to work in linguistics by Zipf, in documentation by Bradford, and
in the science of science by Lotka.. The purpose of this note is to speculate 
further on the relevance of Zipf's law in librarianship..

The Use of Social Science Periodical Literature
.A
Wood, D. N.
.A
Bower, C. A.
.W
   The paper presents the results of a survey of the use of social science 
periodicals carried out at the National Lending Library during a period of four 
weeks in 1968..
   Three-quarters of the requests came from universities and industrial 
organizations and over 90% of the requests were for English language 
publications.. Over a fifth of the requests were for seventeen titles.. There
were marked variations in the subject matter requested by different types of
organizations and although the overall 'half-life' of the literature proved to
be 3 1/2 years this figure varied considerably from one subject to another..
   Concerning the sources of references, it was discovered that compared with
scientists and technologists social scientists make relatively little use of
abstracting and indexing publications..
   Appendixes include a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey, a list of
title requested six or more times, and a list of abstracting and indexing 
publications cited five or more times as sources of references..

   A sample of citations made in 1965 United Kingdom social science literature
has been analyzed according to subject, bibliographic form, country of origin,
language, and date, and comparisons made with citations from science and 
technology literature.. The relative size of the outputs of and demands for 
literature in these fields are estimated, and the subject distribution of 
citation within social science.. The interrelations between source and cited 
subject are discussed.. Use as indicated by citation is compared with use 
measured  by loan demand on the National Lending Library..

Computer Indexing of Medical Articles - Project Medico
.A
Artandi, Susan
.W
   An automatic indexing method is described in which index tags for documents 
are generated by the computer.. The computer scans the text of periodical 
articles and automatically assigns to them index terms with their respective 
weights on the basis of explicitly defined text characteristics.. A machine 
file of document references with their associated index terms is automatically 
produced which can be searched on a co-ordinate basis for the retrieval of 
specified drug-related information..

Progress in Documentation
Empirical Hyperbolic Distributions (Bradford-Zipf-Mandelbrot)
for Bibliometric Description and Prediction
.A
Fairthorne, R.A. 
.W  
  Since 1960, and especially during the past three years, many papers have
appeared about particular manifestations and applications of a certain class
of empirical laws to a field that may be labelled conveniently 'Bibliometrics'.
This term, resuscitated by Alan Pritchard (see page 348), denotes,
in my paraphrase, quantitative treatment of the properties of recorded
discourse and behaviour appertaining to it.
  In this field the law cited is usually that named after Bradford or
Zipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodical
literature or physical access, in the rate of diminishing returns, or in the
cumulative yield from a given input.  The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is,
the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant.  This type of
behaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging from
meteorology to economics, and has given rise to many particular explanations
appropriate to the particular fields.  Thus it has received many names 
according to its exponents, in both senses of that word.

Photocopies v. Periodicals
Cost-Effectiveness in the Special Library
.A
Brookes, B. C.
.W
   Evidence provided by the Dainton Report indicates that special libraries in
the UK are far from fully exploiting the photocopying services provided by the
national libraries.. As these photocopying services are legally obliged to 
operate at cost, they offer significant economies to any special library which 
exploits them systematically..
   This paper describes a simple graphical method of estimating the savings 
that can be made, or the extended subject coverage that can be obtained at no
additional cost, by substituting photocopies for relevant papers in the 
peripheral periodicals relating to any well-defined scientific or technical
subject..
   Though photocopying charges must be realistic, the confident exploitation of 
the national photocopying services depends on the avoidance of arbitrary jumps in
photocopying charges..

The 'Half-Life' of Periodical Literature:  
Apparent and Real Obsolescence
.A
Line, M.B.
.W
  The expression 'half-life', borrowed from physics, has appeared
quite frequently in the literature on documentation since 1960, when an
article by Burton and Kebler on The 'half-life' of some scientific and technical
literatures was published, although it had certainly been used previously.
Burton and Kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather than
disintegrating (as in its original meaning), so that 'half-life' means 'half the
active life', and this is commonly understood as meaning the time during
which one-half of the currently active literature was published.  Numerous
studies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish
obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.  Bourne points out
that different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the
'half-life' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample of
literature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accurate
measures for discriminating between different subject-fields.

  The first diagram below gives a schematic view of a subject literature that
is growing exponentially with time - the number of items published per
year doubles in five years.  Each square of the paper represents a published
item.
  The marks on the diagram represent current uses of the literature (say,
citations made or items borrowed this year).  The inked squares are actual
uses.  The dots are hypothetical uses - those that would occur if every 
published item had an equal chance of being used (in fact, every fifth item is
dotted).

Progress in Documentation
.A
Cleverdon, C.
.W
  Thirty years or more ago, a favoured question in examination papers
for librarians was some variation on the theme 'Compare the merits of a
classified catalogue and an alphabetical subject catalogue'.  This was a
subject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length,
advancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits,
without ever stating a single demonstratable fact.  When, in the early 1950's,
various people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques for
indexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that it
appeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments.  In an
editorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint,
shared by many others, when he wrote: 

    Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is
    essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems.  May
    the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts
    of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems
    of the future.  There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if
    we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the
    benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the
    intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and
    costs.  The machines of the future can make us free, but only if we
    are willing to subject them, and ourselves, to the most rigid
    intellectual discipline.

Switching Languages for Indexing
.A
Coates, E. J.
.W
   The paper describes some properties of simple interconversion devices which
enable material initially subject indexed by a particular indexing system to be
made available to other institutions using different indexing languages in such 
a form as to be readily integrated into their indexes.. Reference is made to the
outline Intermediate Lexicon which is the germinal form of a switching language
for the field of information science.. Difficulties and problems in effecting 
satisfactory information transfer through such an interconversion scheme are
explored, and suggestions made for the lines upon which further research needs
to be undertaken.. The author was the Classification Research Group 
representative on the international working party concerned with the 
Intermediate Lexicon..

Progress in Documentation
.A
Mills, J.
.W
  Classification is so fundamental and pervasive an activity that care
is needed to define its scope when discussing a particular application, such
as information retrieval.
  Retrieval from an information store (a 'library') of those items relevant
to a request involves locating a particular class (describing what we think
we want) and then, if necessary, adjusting this class - broadening it to find
more material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive.  This
implies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole
operation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assuming
that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be
relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of
particular classes and their relations.  The fact that the instrument we use to
assist this operation may display quasi-classificatory features (e.g.,
alphabetical sequence) or may consist largely of our own brain box and memory
store should not hide this otherwise obvious fact.

The Thesaurofacet: A Multipurpose Retrieval Language Tool
.A
Aitchison, Jean
.W
   A description is given of the English Electric 'Thesaurofacet', a faceted 
classification and thesaurus covering engineering and related scientific, 
technical, and management subjects.. A novel feature of the system is the 
integration of the classification schedules and thesaurus.. Each term appears
both in the thesaurus and in the schedules.. In the schedules the term is
displayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy: the thesaurus supplements 
this information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships 
which cut across the classified arrangement.. The thesaurus also controls word 
forms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers.. 
The resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangement 
and conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing and
computerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certain
traditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplines
for main classes, the lack of a 'built-in' preferred order, and the use, in 
certain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-term
concepts.. Methods of application of the Thesaurofacet in pre-coordinate and
post-coordinate systems are discussed and brief account is given of the 
techniques employed in its compilation..

Access and Recognition: from User's Data to Cataloque Entries
.A
Tagliacozzo, Renata

Rosenberg, Lawrence

Kochen, Manfred
.W
   Patterns of searching in library catalogues were analysed,using the data 
from a large survey of the use of three university library and one public 
library catalogues.. 'Known-item' searches were the object of the study..
Success or failure of the search was correlated to degree of correctness and
completeness of the searcher's information about title and author of the item 
that he wished to locate.. Factors involved in searching strategies were 
discussed.. The double role played by both the title and the author as a way of 
access to the catalogue and as a means for identifying the right entry was 
examined..

The Growth, Utility, and Obsolescence of Scientific Periodical Literature
.A
Brookes, B. C.
.W
   Line's recently proposed technique for correcting the 'apparent' half-life
to allow for the rate of growth of the literature and Vickery's critical 
analysis of the proposal are both further analyzed.. Using the concept of 
utility and considering the sampling variances involved, the paper shows that
Line's technique is both questionable and impractical, and that a further 
factor - the growth of the number of contributors - needs to be allowed for in
Vickery's analysis.. A collaborative empirical investigation is proposed..

.A
McCash, W. H.

Carmichael, J. J.
.W
   Extension of the Selective Dissemination of Information system required the
adoption of computer-based techniques.. The indexing language adopted is UDC 
and it was necessary to construct user profiles based on the classification..
Profiles have been compiled for individual clients of the service, for works
within the British Steel Corporation, and for broad fields of activity within 
the iron and steel industry.. Use of the service has shown that UDC provides a 
satisfactory basis for profile compilation.. The majority of profiles so far 
constructed have relevance of over 95%, based on user assessment.. Possible 
future developments in the compilation of the profiles are considered..

thesauri.. It is suggested that if the individual keywords of each 
participating thesaurus represent indentifiable concepts, and these concepts are
given unique code numbers, then the code numbers enable the keywords of any
participating thesaurus to be converted into the appropriate keywords of any
other participant.. Incompatibilities between keywords systems arise from 
differences in the selection and form of keywords.. Eleven types of 
incompatibility are identified and a method of reconciliation is proposed for 
each.. The types of incompatibility that can arise in a single language include 
those that arise between one language and another, so that a multilingual joint 
system presents no additional problems..

Progress in Documentation
.A
Foskett, D.J.
.W
  The term 'informatics' was first advanced formally by the Director
of Viniti, A.I. Mikhailov, and his colleagues A.I. Chernyi and R.S.
Gilyarevskii, in their paper Informatics - new name for the theory of Scientific
Information published at the end of 1966.  An English translation was
circularized in the beginning of 1967.  As the authors state in this paper,
they are not the first to use this term, and they quote a review by Professor
J.G. Dorfmann of their own book Fundamentals of Scientific Information in
which Dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology, such as 'documentation',
'documentalistics', 'information science', and so on.
  Their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider that 
Informatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information,
only the structure and properties.  In their paper they also advance definitions
for 'information', 'scientific information', 'scientific information activity',
'information officer', and 'information scientist'.  They have backed up their
proposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition, and
the title of the information science fascicule of the Referativnyi Zhurnal,
which is now called Informatiki.

Several Law Relations in Science Bibliography - A Self-Consistent 
Interpretation
.A
Naranan, S.
.W
   Several power law relations are found to occur in bibliographic studies of
scientific journals, articles, and citations.. These can be interpreted in a
self-consistent manner in terms of growth parameters of articles, journals, and 
citations.. Similar models have been proposed earlier in physical, biological, 
and behavioral sciences..

Automatic Indexing Using Bibliographic Citations
.A
Salton, G.
.W
   Bibliographic citations attached to technical documents have been used 
variously to refer to related items in the literature, to confer importance to 
a given piece of writing, and to serve as supplementary indications of document
content..In the present study, citations are used directly to identify document
content, and an attempt is made to evaluate their effectiveness in a retrieval 
environment.. It is shown that the use of bibliographic citations in addition 
to the normal keyword-type indicators produces improved retrieval performance, 
and that in some circumstances, citations are more effective for retrieval 
purposes than other more conventional terms and concepts..

The Extension on Users' Literature Awareness as a Measure of Retrieval 
Performance, and Its Application to MEDLARS
.A
Miller, William L.
.W
   The performance of a retrieval system with a file of only a few hundred 
references can be measured by assessing the relevance of each reference to each 
of a number of queries.. A suitable measure of retrieval performance is then the
Recall ratio - the fraction of the relevant references that are retrieved by the
system.. When the file is large this method of measuring performance is not 
practicable, and Recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated.. A
number of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory.. Another
measure of retrieval performance is the Extension ratio which is approximately
the ratio of the quantity of known relevant references before and after putting 
a query to the retrieval system.. The properties of this measure are examined 
and it is applied to 315 MEDLARS searches..

   Comparative performance profiles were determined, by two independent 
scientific information centres, for on-line retrieval by means of (a) free text 
words and (b) subject indexing codes, from a data base of 4,600 descriptions of 
in-going research projects in four broad subject areas.. Altogether, thirty-nine
questions that users had previously asked of the Science Information Exchange
(SIE) of the Smithsonian Institution, and that were in the four subjects areas,
were employed by SIE staff scientists, and twelve of these were independently 
used by staff members of the Biological Science Communication Project (BSCP) of 
the George Washington University.. Results of the two studies showed average 
recall values 30-40% higher, and relevance values 15-20% higher, for subject 
index code use as compared with text word use.. Advantages and disadvantages of 
both approaches are discussed..

The Use of Older Literature and Its Obsolescence
.A
Sandison, A.
.W
   Terminalogy and parameters for describing the relation between figures for
the use of library literature and for its age are discussed.. Unless a 
correction for growth is applied, half-life fails a simple test of suitability,
as do Brookes's aging and utility factors.. Results based on cumulated data
have other important disadvantages.. Relative 'use-per-item' figures are 
satisfactory.. The need to relate terminology more closely to the facts they
represent is stressed: item-consultation decay rate, and 50% consultation 
probability age are suggested and defined.. In the context of citation studies,
item-citation decay rate and 50% citation probability age are equivalent and 
avoid similar objections..
   In data from NRLSI, item-consultation decay rates are only approximately 
exponential.. Different rates are demonstrated for updating and basic searches,
for academic and other types of readers, and for types of literature.. For some
historical searches negative decay rates were found in the NRLSI and BML..

A Single Computer-Based System for Both Current Awareness and Retrospective 
Search: Operating Experience with ASSASSIN
.A
Clough, C. R.

Bramwell, K. M.
.W
   ASSASSIN as designed and operated by ICI Agricultural Division, provides from
a single paper tape input a current awareness service by SDI and a retrospective
search both by a weighted term machine search and printed KWOC-type indexes.. 
Programs for producing structured thesauri are part of the package.. Input is in
the form of abstracts from both published and internal source..  
   The system has operated for more than a year at the Agricultural Division and
is currently in use at five other locations.. Flexibility of the package is
demonstrated by the variety of applications..
   This paper outlines the various applications and shows how a single package
may be used complete, or in part, or with modification.. Machine costs are given
for the major application..
   The system was designed with the possible input of externally produced 
machine readable data in mind.. The intended application of the package in
conjunction with tapes such as those of the Institute for Scientific Information
source and Chemical Abstracts Condensates is outlined..

A Probabilistic Search Strategy for MEDLARS
.A
Miller, William L.
.W
   One technique for searching a Co-ordinate Index is to compare each reference
with a Boolean expression of index terms.. This divides the file into retrieved
and not-retrieved references.. An alternative is to assign each reference score
calculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring 
references in the file.. This scoring technique has several advantages in
theory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal to
the number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search.. In the
test a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less then this number of
references matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring technique
successfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many 
relevant references as the Boolean searches..

Measuring Readers' Failure at the Shelf
.A
Urquhart, John A.
.A
Schofield, J. L.
.W
   This paper is concerned with the availability of books known to be held by 
the Library.. It outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the 
non-availability of books which they are looking for.. The survey has already
been installed at four university libraries, but the results from only one 
library are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find out
the degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library,
the causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demand
and not available..
   They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers, 
the number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc., the overlap of 
demand for popular books by different groups of borrowers, the waiting time for 
books that failed, the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of 
time, the relationship between failure and recall, the correlation of failure 
from one term to the next, and the relative use of books inside and outside the 
library..
   From the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library 
procedure which should have reduced failure, and to compare the titles of books
failing in the Main Library with the holdings of a departmental library.. The 
time spent on the survey and the total cost of the survey are also given..

A Statistical Interpretation of Term Specificity 
and Its Application in Retrieval
.A
Sparck-Jones, K.
.W
   The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms
are usually regarded as independent.. It is suggested that specificity should be
interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term 
meaning.. The effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are 
examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that
frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance.. It is
argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that 
matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches
on frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerable 
improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure..

Comparative Efficiency of Searching Titles, Abstracts, and Terms 
in a Free-Text Data Base
.A
Barcer, F. H.

Veal, D. C.
.A
Wyatt, B. K.
.W
   The choice of the suitable data base for providing an information service is
governed by factors of coverage, performance, and cost.. The cost of the data 
base to subscribers is a known quantity, and the coverage is decided by the data
base producers..
   This paper describes an investigation into the relative performance of the
four major Chemical Abstracts Service magnetic tape data-base, Chemical Titles 
(CT), which contains the titles of citations only, Chemical Abstracts 
Condensates (CAC), which contains titles enriched with keyword phrases,
Chemical-Biological Activities (CBAC),and Polymer Science and Technology (POST),
both of which contain full digests in addition to titles..
   The performance was measured in terms of the relative currency of the four
data-bases, on the retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against them.. 
Fifty questions from industrial and government research organizations were used 
in the experiment.. Search profiles corresponding to these questions were
constructed for searching against each database, output was assessed for 
relevance by users, and profile performance figures (precision and recall 
ratios) were calculated for each profile.. The overall retrieval efficiency of
profiles searched against data-bases containing titles only,
titles-plus-keywords, and titles-plus-digests, was calculated, and these results 
are presented..

Standard Times for Information Systems: 
A Method for Data Collection and Analysis
.A
Wilkin, A. P.
.A
Reynolds, R.
.A
Robertson, S. E.
.W
   With a view of obtaining a set of standard times for information system 
operations, Aslib Research Department is developing and testing methods for 
collecting and analyzing data on the time taken to perform certain operations..
The current state of development of these methods is described.. Data collection
is by a self-recording (diary) method, completed at the time of performing the 
operation.. The major problem is one of identifying, describing, and analyzing 
the effect of the various factors which might affect the time.. First results 
indicate that it is possible to explain a large proportion of the variations in 
individual times by taking account of a sufficient number of variables..

Measuring Readers' Failure at the Shelf in Three University Libraries
.A
Urquhart, John A.
.A
Schofield, J. L.
.W
   This paper continues the reporting of the Unit's work on a method of 
investigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on the 
shelves, why they fail, and what particular books they fail to find..
   The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers were
asked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they
were looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status,
and the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis of
these 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader's
failure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern of
failure for different groups of volumes..
  A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during the
fortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on the
effect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whether
he found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and what
proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could be
checked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library..
   The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with 
its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns.. These 
differences were reflected in the results obtained..
   It is hoped that the methods of investigation used can be employed by 
librarians to investigate the effectiveness of some of the services in their own
libraries..

The Aberrystwyth Index Languages Test
.A
Keen, Michael E.
.W
   Reports a laboratory comparision of the effectiveness and efficiency of five 
index languages in the subject area of library and information science; three 
post-co-ordinate languages, Compressed Term, Uncontrolled, and Hierarchically 
Structured, and two pre-co-ordinate ones, Hierarchically Structures and 
Relational Indexing.. Eight test comparisons were made, and factors studied
were index language specificity and linkage, indexing specificity and 
exhaustivity, method of co-ordination, the precision devices of partitioning 
and relational operators, and the provision of context in the search file.. 
Full details of the test and retrieval results are presented..

Progress in Documentation:
Research in User Behaviour in University Libraries
.A
Ford, G.
.W
  The task of the librarian is to achieve his library's objectives.  A
simplistic statement, perhaps, but it is rare that a library's objectives
are defined in any terms other than the broadest - for example, 'to meet
the needs of its users'.  In fact, the definition of objectives in any
service organization is likely to be an iterative process, but the
explicit commitment to users' needs (however mystical this concept may
be) requires the librarian to examine users' behaviour as a first step
to determining policy.  Since a complete state-of-the-art in user 
behaviour would fill a substantial book, this survey is restricted to
drawing together some threads of research of potential application in
university libraries.  Methodological problems are not discussed here,
since these are adequately reviewed elsewhere.

Document Analysis and Linguistic Theory
.A
Gardin, Lean-Claude
.W
   In this presentation I shell be concerned with only one aspect of information
science and its relation with linguistics: namely document analysis..
   'Document analysis' is here understood in following sense: the extraction
of meaning of documents - in the present case written documents.. We could 
define the latter without reference to the usual distinction between 'scientific
literature' (the object of document analysis in information science) and other
kinds of texts - historical records, myths, folklore, sacred writings, etc.)..
Indeed, one of my theses in that there is little hope of understanding the kind 
of intellectual operations involved in the analysis of scientific documents, or
questions pertaining to them other than through a study of textual analysis in 
general, as carried out in many disciplines - history, sociology, cultural
anthropology, exegesis. etc. (Gardin, 1969).. For the purpose of this 
presentation, however, I shall concentrate on the handling of  scientific 
documents in the first, narrower sense, and only refer to other categories of 
texts in so far as they have been submitted to analytical processes of a 
comparable nature..

Studies to Compare Retrieval Using Titles with that Using Index Terms.
SDI from 'Nuclear Science Abstracts'
.A
Olive, G.
.A
Terry, J. E.
.A
Datta, S.
.W
   A Selective dissemination of Information service based on computer scanning
of Nuclear Science Abstracts tapes has operated at Harwell since October 1968..
Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA 
subject categories assigned to each item in NSA..
   The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of
the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of
journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be
providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, 
to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of 
lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily..
   In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on 
titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty 
users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were 
generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in 
titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. 
Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The 
average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index 
terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed 
many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% 
of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%..
   No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative 
effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were 
analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 
characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a 
lower precision..
   A detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by 
computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other, was made
to identify reasons for failure..

Recent Growth of the Literature of Biochemistry 
and Changes in Ranking of Periodicals
.A
Sengupta, I. N.
.W
   The ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to the
study of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s.. As a result a rapid and 
large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and 
biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The
consequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great 
difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To 
cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals
in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review 
of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the 
impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately 
than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the 
predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort 
today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical
methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to 
size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been
developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which 
should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in 
relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information 
content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of 
presentation..
   The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to 
Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, 
namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a 
scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in 
increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that 
the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers 
in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their 
significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research..

A Cost Survey of Mechanized Information Systems
.A
Vickers, P. H.
.W
   In the course of the survey covered by this paper, cost data were collected
by visiting eighteen operational computer-based systems in Europe and the USA,
using a structured cost analysis scheme.. The sample included data-base 
producers and self-contained systems that both create, and provide services 
from, a data base..
   From the data obtained, unit costs have been derived for most operations, 
and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed..
   Analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly by 
factors such as system management, salary variations, and productivity of staff,
than by technical factors such as depth of indexing, data preparation methods, 
or computer programming..
   The total operating budgets of most of the systems have also been analysed to
show the overall pattern of cost distribution, including overheads..

Progress in Documentation:
Measuring the Goodness of Library Services:
A General Framework for Considering Quantitative Measures
.A
Orr, R.H.
.W
  The literature of the last few decades reflects a steadily increasing
concern with quantitative assessment of libraries and their services.  This
concern is both the result of, and a reaction to, growing pressures from
within and without the library profession to adopt the tools of the
management sciences.  The pressures are generated by many factors including
the success of these tools in other fields and their adoption by the
organizations supporting libraries, the increasingly explicit character
of competition for funds at all levels, and the complexity and critical
nature of decisions on the host of new options being created by technology
and by formalization of library networks.

On the Specification of Term Values in Automatic Indexing
.A
Salton, G.
.A
Yang, C. S.
.W
   The existing practice in automatic indexing is reviewed, and it is shown
 that the standard theories for the specification of term values (or weights)
are not adequate.. New techniques are introduced for the assignment of weights
to index terms, based on the characteristics of individual document 
collections.. The effectiveness of some of the proposed methods is evaluated..

Progress in Documentation:
The Development of Precis:  
A Theoretical and Technical History
.A
Austin, D.
.W
  Before starting to trace the development of PRECIS to its
theoretical beginnings I shall describe the system briefly in its present
form.  This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are not
familiar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance of
some of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how a
machine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derived
from a study of natural language, developed out of research into 
principles for a new general classification.
  PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some
respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings.
Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index,
PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed
list of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of an
open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the
index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature.
Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are
handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the
semantic sides of the system.

User Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Cleverdon, C.W.
.W
  While Fairthorne may not have been the first person to recognize it,
certainly, for this author, Fairthorne was the first to make explicit the
fundamental problems of information retrieval systems, namely the clash
between OBNA and ABNO (Only-But-Not-All and All-But-Not-Only).
Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne's
writings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARD
Documentation Panel and elsewhere.  Originally it was considered that to meet
these two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems,
and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis
that a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different from
a 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM).  While the idea persisted in this form
for some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall
and precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of the
relevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But-
Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only.

A Study of Current Awareness Publications in the Neurosciences
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
  Mailed questionnaires were used to study the use of two printed current
awareness devices in specialized areas of the neurosciences, one manually
prepared and the other a product of MEDLARS.  The study determined who
uses each publication, how much, for what purpose, and with what degree of
success.  A major purpose was to discover how valuable the publications are
to users and what impact they have had on their own research or professional
practice as well as on their information seeking behaviour.  Comparisons
are made between the results for the two publications.  Some conclusions are
drawn on information seeking behaviour in the neuroscience community and
on requirements for effective current awareness services in this field.

  The mathematical theory of measurement is used to construct a framework
for the evaluation of information retrieval strategies.  The model arrived at
is based on precision and recall.  After a detailed examination of the kind of
conditions the model can be expected to satisfy a plausible measure of
effectiveness is derived.  Finally, a number of other measures are shown to be
special cases of it.

  This article reviews the state of the art in automatic indexing, that is,
automatic techniques for analyzing and characterizing documents, for
manipulating their descriptions in searching, and for generating the index
language used for these purposes.  It concentrates on the literature from
1968 to 1973.  Section I defines the topic and its context.  Sections II and III
consider work in syntax and semantics respectively in detail.  Section IV
comments on 'indirect' indexing.  Section V briefly surveys operating
mechanized systems.  In Section VI major experiments in automatic indexing
are reviewed, and Section VII attempts an overall conclusion on the current
state of automatic indexing techniques.

   The proposition is examined that large-scale photocopying, such as that 
practised by the British Library Lending Division, affects the sales of 
journals.. There is little evidence of a reduction in journal circulation
figures.. In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen much
faster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), university
libraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high 
proportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are 
now forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD 
shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them 
well established journals, widely held by libraries and with large 
circulations.. The demand for in-print issues of the average journal is small..
It is concluded, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that economic
difficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the 
BLLD are unrelated, though both owe something to the economic pressures on 
libraries..

The Status of 'Practicum' in Graduate Library Schools
.A
Grotzinger, L.
.W
  The early schools were dedicated to practical work as a
necessary component of every program; this fact is
heavily documented in numerous commentaries on the time.
As this century progressed, however, this pioneer 
preoccupation came under strong criticism and by the 
1930's and in more recent decades, an equally strong
documentation attacks the earlier curricula.  Now, in
the 1970's amid the many questions raised about the
relevance of contemporary library education, there
appears to be a revival in the use of field experiences.

   A new linear notation system is described which was designed to have a 
one-to-one correspondence with the chemical structures represented by the 
notations.. Each notation is unique and unambiguous, yet simple and compatible 
with computer input and output characters.. The symbols used in the notation 
system denote carbon in terms of bounds and attached hydrogen(s).. The notation 
system is illustrated with acyclic, carbocyclic, and heterocyclic examples..

Information Requirements in the Social Sciences: 
Some Preliminary Considerations

   Information requirements in the social sciences are almost entirely 
unexplored.. I shall argue that exploration is desirable; discuss some of the
reasons why this is so; attempt an analysis of the factors to be investigated; 
and consider some possible methods of investigation.. This article is an early 
by-product of the Investigation into Information Requirements of the Social 
Sciences, being carried out by two researchers under my direction,and supported 
by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information.. It is based on the 
Report on the Preliminary Stage, presented to OSTI in April, 1968..

Prospects for a New General Classification
.A
Austin, Derec
.W
   In traditional classification schemes, the universe of knowledge is broken down
into self-contained disciplines which are further analysed to the point at which
a particular concept is decated.. This leads to problems of:
   (a) currency: keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries..
   (b) hospitality: allowing room for insertion of new subjects..
   (c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it 
       fits as logically into one discipline as another..
   Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is
notated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears..
   The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every 
concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires
the notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that
all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they
belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes..
In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from
appropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the
final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental 
relationships between concepts..
   Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can be 
seen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles and 
Attributes as its vocabulary..

Information Services in University Libraries
.A
Line, M.B.
.W
  Development in university libraries in recent years in reader services,
instruction in library use and subject specialization go only a small way
to meeting the problems created by the "information explosion."  Reasons
why more dynamic and personal information services for scientists and
social scientists should be developed include the limitations in researchers'
present use of libraries and information, the preference of users for informal
channels of communication, increasing pressures on the time of university
teachers, and problems associated with computer retrieval systems.  Specialist
posts of information officer should be created as part of the library services,
but with functions distinct from those of the librarian; difficulties that
may arise with their location and operation are discussed.  The cost of
information services in depth is heavy, but it may be possible to develop
them within the existing budget by a reallocation of funds and staff duties.

   A simple model of a two-stage hierarchical library system is described.. The
model indicates, in terms of "user costs" and library "viability", how the 
branch library should be stocked.. The most significant factor used in the 
analysis is shown to be the ratio of the two actual user costs, rather than the 
actual costs themselves.. It is shown that the viability level of stock 
provision of the branch library is determined by this ratio..

suggested that these techniques are applicable to libraries and librarians and
will become increasingly useful as the problems of increased work loads become

for system design and planning, providing such data is put in its proper 
context and particularly if it is used to improve effectiveness as well as

Administrative Effectiveness: Times and Costs of Library Operations
.A
Smith, G. C. K.
Schofield, J. L.
.W
   The kinds of information needed by managing librarians to make correct 
decisions are considered, with emphasis on the value of current data on the 
exceptional situation.. Management information in a library is of greatest use 
in comparison, either internally, or with data from other libraries.. A simple,
standard method of recording and costing is urged, so that librarians may 
readily identify procedures requiring improvement..
   Development of the present costing method is traced from its original state
as a simple management information system based on exception reporting (i.e.
reporting the exceptions which occur in any particular survey), through a pilot 
study in a large university library, to its full installation in two further 
university libraries.. The method of analyzing the raw data is described, and
examples of the tables are given, together with brief background information on 
the libraries concerned..
   After a note on the limitations of the present costing method and of unit 
costs in general, unit times and costs are given for numerous operations in 
both the libraries surveyed, covering both reader and technical services.. There
is agreement between results of several American studies and those of the 
present investigation.. For further comparison, the information on times and
salaries has been used in conjunction with a standard civil service costing
procedure..

and university library structure shows how the system can bring about
organizational strains and conflict situations in respect of career patterns
of senior staff members.  The need to recognize academic considerations for
library promotions is stressed and a case made out for the fullest involvement
of all senior library staff in policy-making.

A Personalized Service to Academic Researchers:
the Experimental Information Service in the Social
Sciences at the University of Bath
.A
Evans, S.M.
Line, M.B.
.W
  Between 1969 and 1971 Bath University Library experimented with a personalized
information service to social science researchers at the Universities of Bath
and Bristol.  The principal service offered was a manual current awareness 
service, based mainly on the scanning of primary and abstracting journals.
The service was evaluated by feedback slips returned by clients for each
reference notified, and by a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. The
relevance performance was good, and few references had been seen before; some
precision could have been sacrificed to ensure comprehensive recall.  The whole
service was rated highly by nearly all users and considered to be a high 
priority among the various possible claims on university resources.  Those
who had the closest contact with the information officers had the best
scores on most aspects evaluated and rated the service most highly.  Some
general observations on the place and value of an information service in a
university library are given in conclusion.

Jesse Shera and the Theory of Bibliography
.A
Brookes, B.C.
.W
  Twenty years ago Jesse Shera suggested that there was a need for a more
analytical study of bibliography which might help to bridge library and
information services.  Little note was taken of this proposal at the time
but developments have since occurred and are here briefly reported.  It is
argued that Shera's "macrobibliography" or "social epistemology" provides
not only a subject for theoretical study but that it will also be needed
for the rational design of library and information systems and networks of
the near future.

Library Instruction and the Development of the Individual
.A
Hills, P. J.
.W
   The purpose of a university education is defined here as the need to guide
the student towards becoming a self-directing individual.. This paper examines
this purpose in terms of student needs and the awareness of both academic and
library staff.. Psychological principles of learning as applied to this purpose
are considered together with the use of audio-visual methods.. The paper ends
with a consideration of some present practical constraints and the possibilities
for future action..

A Book Catalog at Stanford
.A
Johnson, Richard D.
.W
   Description of a system for the production of a book catalog for an 
undergraduate library, using an IBM 1401 Computer (12K storage, 4 tape drives),
an expanded print chain on the 1403 Printer, and an 029 Card Punch for input..
Described are the conversion of cataloging information into machine readable 
form, the machine record produced, the computer programs employed, and printing 
of the catalog.. The catalog, issued annually, is in three parts: an author
title catalog, a subject catalog, and a shelf list.. Cumulative supplements are 
issued quarterly.. A central idea in the depiction of entries in the catalog is 
the abandonment of the main entry concept.. The alphabetical arrangement of 
entries is discussed: sort keys employed, filing order observed, symbols 
employed to alter this order, and problems encountered.. Cost factors involved 
in the preparation of the catalog are summarized..

The Development and Administration of automated systems 
in Academic Libraries
.A
De Gennardo, Richard
.W
   The first part of this paper considers three general approaches to the
development of an automation program in a large research library.. The library
may decide simply to wait for developments; it may attempt to develop a total 
or integrated system from the start; or it may adopt an evolutionary approach
leading to an integrated system.. Outside consultants,it is suggested, will 
become increasingly important.. The second part of the paper deals with 
important elements in any program regardless of the approach.. These include
the building of a capability to do automation work, staffing, equipment,
organizational structure, selection of projects, and costs..

Atherton, Pauline
Tessier, Judith
.W
   A computer based laboratory for library science students to use in class 
assignments and for independent projects has been developed and used for one 
year at Syracuse University.. MARC Pilot Project tapes formed the data base.. 
Different computer programs and various samples of the MARC file (48,000 
records, approx.) were used for search and retrieval operations..  Data bases,
programs, and seven different class assignments are described and evaluated for 
their impact on library education in general and individual students and faculty
in particular..

Standardized Costs for Automated Library Systems
.A
Jacob, Mary Ellen L.
.W
   Costs of the automated library systems as currently given in published 
reports tend to be misleading and confusing.. It is necessary to have a clear 
understanding of how they were derived before any comparisons can be made..
Clearly defined costs in terms of time units are more meaningful than straight 
dollar costs and can be used as one means of comparison among various system 
designs and as guidelines for the design of new systems..

An Algorithm for Variable-Length Proper-Name Compression
.A
Dolby, James L.
.W
   Viable on-line search systems require reasonable capabilities to
automatically detect (and hopefully correct) variations between request
format and stored format.. An important requirement is the solution of the
problem of matching proper names, not only because both input specifications
and storage specifications are subject ot error, but also because various 
transliteration schemes exist and can provide variant proper name forms in 
the same data base.. This paper reviews several proper name matching schemes
and provides an updated version of these schemes which tests out nicely on
the proper name equivalence classes of a suburban telephone book..  An
appendix lists the corpus of names used for algorithm test.

Scope: A Cost Analysis of an Automated Serials Record System
.A
Koenig, Michael E.
Finlay, Alexander C.
Cushman, Joann G.
Detmer, James M.
.W
   A computerized serials record and control system developed in 1968/69 for the
Technical Information Department of Pfizer Inc. is described and subjected to a 
cost analysis.. This cost analysis is conducted in the context of an investment
decision, using the concept of net present value, a method not previously used 
in library literature.. The cost analysis reveals a positive net present value
and a system life break-even requirement of seven years at a 10% cost of 
capital.. This demonstrates that such an automated system can be economically
justifiable in a library of relatively modest size (approx. 1,100 serial and
periodical titles).. It may be that the break-even point in terms of collection
size required for successful automation of serial records is smaller than has 
been assumed to date..

dissemination and provides a description of a highly flexible cooperative SDI 
system developed by the Library, University of Saskatchewan, and the National 
Science Library.. The system will permit searching over all subject areas 
represented by the English language monographic literature on MARC..

An Algorithm for Compaction of Alphanumeric Data
.A
Schieber, William D.
Thomas, George W.
.W
   Description of a technique for compressing data to be placed in computer
auxiliary storage.. The technique operates on the principle of taking two
alphabetic characters frequently used in combination and replacing them with
one unused special character code.. Such one-for-two replacement has enabled
the ILO to achieve a rate of compression of 43.5% on a data base of 
approximately 40,000 bibliographic records..

   Two research keys (4,5 and 3,3) are analyzed using a probability formula on
a bibliographic file of 857,725 records.. Assuming random requests by record 
permits the creation of a predictive model which more closely approximates 
the actual behavior of a search and retrieval system as determined by a usage 
survey..

Content Designators for Machine-Readable Records: A Working Paper
.A
Avram, Henriette D.
Guiles, Kay D.
.W
   Under the auspices of the International Federation of Library Association's
Committees on Cataloging and Mechanization, an International Working Group on
Content Designators was formed to attempt to resolve the differences in the 
content designators assigned by national agencies to their machine-readable 
bibliographic records..
   All working papers emanating from the IFLA Working Group will be submitted
to the International Standards Organization Technical Committee 46, Subcommittee 
4, Working Group on Content Designators..
   Prior to any attempt to standardize the content designators for the 
international exchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form, it is 
necessary to agree on certain basic points from which all future work will be 
derived.. This first working paper is a statement of: 1) the obstacles that 
presently exist which prevent the effective international interchange of
bibliographic data in machine-readable form; 2) the score of concern for the
IFLA Working Group; and 3) the definition of terms included in the broader term
"content designators"..
   If an international standard format can be derived, it would greatly 
facilitate the use in this country of machine-readable bibliographic records
issued by other national agencies.. It should also contribute significantly to 
the expansion of MARC to other languages by the Library of Congress..

The New York Public Library Automated Book Catalog Subsystem
.A
Malinconico, S. Michael
Rizzolo, James A.
.W
   A comprehensive automated bibliographic control system has been developed by
the New York Public Library.. This system is unique in its use of an automated 
authority system and highly sophisticated machine  filing algorithms.. The 
primary aim was the rigorous control of established forms and their 
cross-reference structure.. The original impetus for creation of the system,
and its most highly visible product, is a photocomposed book catalog.. The 
book catalog subsystem supplies automatic punctuation of condensed entries and
contains the ability to produce cumulation/supplement book catalogs in 
installments without loss of control of the cross referencing structure..

The Ad Hoc Discussion Group on Serials Data Bases: Its History, Current
Position, and Future
.A
Anable, Richard
.W
The Ad Hoc Discussion Group on Serials Data Bases was formed as a
result of an informal meeting held during the American Library Association's
Conference in Las Vegas on June 26, 1973.  Those in attendance were
primarily interested in the generation and maintenance of machine-readable
union files of serials.  (This author's involvement in that meeting and
the later activities of the group stems from a contract between the
National Library of Canada and York University concerning an investigation
of the problems associated with machine-readable serials files.)

Providing Bibliograhic Services From Machine-Radable Data Bases -
The Library's Role
.A
De Gennaro, Richard
.W
   Libraries will play a key role in providing access to data bases, but not by
subscribing to tape services and establishing local processing centers as is
commonly assumed.. High costs and the nature of the demand will make this 
approach unfeasible.. It is more likely that the library's reference staff will
develop the capability of serving as a broker between the local campus user and 
the various regional or specialized retail distribution centers which exist or 
will be established..

BIBCON - A General Purpose Software System for MARC-Based Book Catalog
Production
.A
Gibson, Liz
.W
   The BIBCON file management system, designed for use on IBM 360 system 
equipment, performs two basic functions: (1) it creates MARC structured, 
bibliographic records from untagged input data; (2) from these records it 
produces page image output for book catalogs.. The system accepts data from
several different input devices and can produce a variety of output formats by 
line printer, photocomposition, or computer output microform (COM)..

Impact of National Developments on Library Technical Services and Public
Services
.A
Fasana, Paul J.

   Several recently established national programs are evaluated from the point
of view of the practicing librarian.. It is essential that we be aware of the 
consequences of adopting these programs, and that planners and librarians
communicate adequately..

MEDLARS II: A Third Generation Bibliographic Production System
.A
Katter, Robert V.
Pearson, Karl M.
.W
   MEDLARS II, the replacement  for the MEDLARS system used by the National 
Library of Medicine over the past decade, incorporates a number of major 
advances in the state of the art for massive information retrieval systems: 
on-line access to a number of very large bibliographic files, an efficient 
throughput  figure, validation and mapping of inputs against authority files,
and modularity and parametric programming to provide the flexibility needed to
support future system enhancements.. Major MEDLARS II subsystems described are:
(1) specification maintenance, (2) input and release, (3) file maintenance, 
(4) retrieval, (5) publication production, and (6) management reporting.. The 
MEDLARS II retrieval subsystem (ELHILL) incorporated the results of the 
experimental AIM-TWX service..

State of the Nation in Networking
.A
Butler, B.
.W
    There is little so ephemeral as a "Current review" in an area so rapidly
changing as library networking.  Yet this very characteristic of rapid change
makes valid the effort of providing an overview at a point in time.
    The first task, then, is network definition and description, necessary
because a large number of library activities have been described as "networks"
and only a limited number are covered here.  The chapter on "Library and
Information Networks" in volume seven of the Annual Review of Information
Science and Technology provides a "normative list" of "essential 
characteristics":
    1. A network's function is to marshal resources ... to accomplish results
       beyond the ability of any one of its members.
    2. A network has developed an organizational design and structure that
       allows it to establish an identifiable domain....
    3. It has a base in communications technology.

   The results of a study carried out under the auspices of the Council on 
Library Resources are described.. The stated goal of this study was to 
determine and analyze the current state of planning and implementation for 
computer-generated replacements for the card catalog (book catalog, microimage
catalog, on-line catalog) for large collections (250,000 titles or more) and
selected smaller libraries (less than 250,000 titles) that had actually
implemented an alternative form of catalog..

Serials Data Control:  Current Problems and Prospects
.A
Fasana, P.
.W
  This paper will describe three areas of current serials activity which are
of importance to conventional libraries.  I would like to do this in general
terms, eschewing details which only seem to serve to confuse.  The three
areas are:
  l. Standards.  What they are, what impact they can have, what influence
     they currently are having on serials processing.
  2. Standards Setting Projects. I will attempt to describe and/or define
     the almost incestuous intricacies of the National Serials Data Program
     (NSDP), the International Serials Data System (ISDS), and CONSER
     (CONversion of SERials).
  3. Code Revision Activities.  I will outline the influence that current
     standards and projects are having on code revision activities.
  My comments are to be considered within the context of conventional
libraries, primarily one wherein card catalogs still exist and manual processes
are the rule.

A Comprehensive Study Based on Physics Abstracts
.A
Keeman, S.
.W
  The Documentation Research Project of the American Institute has been
engaged for some years in an effort to improve the various systems available
for the publication and dissemination of physics literature.  Numerous
aspects of the problem have been studied and much information has been
obtained from the projects listed in the bibliography which appears on
the inside cover of this Report.  Studies which resulted in the determination
of the indexing requirements of research physicists, new methods for the
content analysis and indexing of physics research papers, and better
production methods for journal indexes have formed the backbone of the work
which has as its ultimate objective the creation of a reference retrieval system 
which is adequate for the physicists who will use it.

Pattern Recognition and Structure-Activity Relationship Studies.. 
Computer-Assisted Prediction of Antitumor Activity in Structurally Diverse
Drugs in an Experimental Mouse Brain Tumor System
.A
Chu, K. C.
Feldman, R. J.
Shapiro, M. B.
Hazard, G. F. Jr.
Geran, R. I.
.W
   This paper reports the application of pattern recognition and substructural 
analysis to the problem of predicting the antineoplastic activity of 24 test 
compounds in an experimental mouse brain tumor system based on 138 structurally
diverse compounds tested in this tumor system.. The molecules were represented 
by three types of substructural fragments, the augmented atom, the heteropath, 
and the ring fragments.. Of the two pattern recognition methods used to predict
the activity of the test compounds the nearest neighbor method predicted 83%
correctly while the learning machine  method predicted 92% correctly.. The test
structures and the important substructural fragments used in this study are 
given and the implications of these results are discussed..

   The Price Gilbert Memorial Library of the Georgia Institute of Technology has 
reproduced its entire card catalog on microfiche, and is updating this basic 
file with a bimonthly cumulated supplement produced by the Computer Output
Microfiche (COM) process.. The total catalog has been placed, with in 
appropriate microfiche reader, in every academic and research department on
campus - thereby taking the chief bibliographic record of the library to the 
faculty user.. Remote bibliographic access is complemented by a telephone 
request and delivery service which provides delivery of requested books or
photocopies from the library to the faculty member..

The Frequency Distribution of Scientific Productivity.
.A
Lotka, A.J.
.W
  It would be of interest to determine, if possible, the part which men
of different calibre contribute to the progress of science.
  Considering first simple volume of production, a count was made of
the number of names, in the decennial index of Chemical Abstracts   
1907-1916, against which appeared 1, 2, 3 . . . . entries.  Names
of firms (e.g. Aktiengesellschaft, etc.) were omitted from reckoning,
since they represent the output, not of a single individual, but of an
unknown number of persons.  The letters A and B of the alphabet
only were covered.  These were treated both separately and in the
aggregate, with the results shown in the table and in figures 1 and 2
below.

An Experiment in Index Term Frequency
.A
Svenonius, Elaine
.W
   This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factor
in retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its "breadth" as
it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given 
collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which
function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those
which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment
and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by 
nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using 
the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the 
usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the 
statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the 
"optimal" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few
documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more
effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents
are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for 
the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never 
improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A
corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same
average breadth where one indexing consists of
semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the
other consists of merely "reasonable" index terms.. The result suggest that 
title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior..

Design Equations for Retrieval System Based on the Swets Model
.A
Heine, M. H.
.W
   Swets's theory of information retrieval allows the threads of document
weighting formulae, probabilistic measures of effectiveness, and management 
theory to be woven into a coherent pattern.. Benefits of the theory are the
beginnings of a quantitative description of retrieval languages, a clear 
distinction between retrieval 'systems' and 'language', a recognition that 
retrieval performance can be tailored to suit individual needs in a systematic 
way, and confirmation that question Generality is a pivotal feature of the 
retrieval process.. The hypotheses involved are still in need of rigorous 
experimental testing..

Job Dimensions and Educational Needs in Librarianship
.A
Kertendick, T.T.
.W
  This study was undertaken to meet more fully the demands for
improved and expanded training of library personnel, especially at the
middle and upper levels, occasioned by the rapidly changing roles and
functions of libraries as they try to adapt to the vast social, economic,
and technological changes currently in progress.  The rise to a higher
level of required skills and competencies - often new - has brought about
an urgent need for improved training beyond the first professional
degree at the post-master's level.  The basic purpose of this research is
curriculum development at the post-master's level that will equip the
middle- and upper-level personnel in libraries for the changes confronting
them.  Although it would be possible to restructure the master's program
and add the courses that this study shows a need for, that alternative
has not been pursued for two reasons: a fairly stable master's curriculum
is widely accepted and institutionalized and, more important, the new
courses are designed for a different group of students - experienced
librarians.

.W
   An on_line cataloging pilot project for two elementary school is discussed..
The system components are 2740 terminals, upper-lower-case input, IBM's FASTER
generalized software package, and usual cards/labels output.. Reasons for 
choosing FASTER, software and hardware features, operating procedures, system
performance and costs are detailed. Future expansion to cataloging 100,000 
annual K-12 acquisitions, on-line circulation, retrospective conversion, and 
union book catalogs is set forth..

Classification Systems
.A
Soergel, D.
.W
  The field of documentation originated from the desire of librarians
to arrange the document collection by subject areas.  Mono-Dicraredical
Classification systems were developed for this purpose which made it
possible in each case to find a single clearly defined category for each
bibliographic item.  The development of modern science has brought about
two principal changes in the situation:
  First it is no longer enough to simply provide for the retrieval
of complete bibliographic items as a unit, but rather one tends more and
more to request informational details that may be contained in the book.
Second, modern knowledge has become too complex and interdependent that it is 
no longer possible to provide a single well-defined category for the books or
journal articles.

Technical Scientific Information and the Efficient Application of Science
.A
Mikhailov, A.
.W
The intense development of science and its immediate application in production
is one of the characteristic feelings of our time. The growth of the economy 
now depends more and more on the speed of scientific research.
One of the main tasks of the five-year plan (1971-1975) is to develop in every
possible way basic and applied scientific research and to rapidly introduce their
results into the national economy.
The Directives of the 24th Congress of the CPSU emphasize the need to improve
scientific-technical information, and to guarantee the systematic transfer to
interested fields and institutions of information on scientific achievements
and progressive experimentation in the areas of technology, the organization of
production, and production management.

The Language Barrier; a study in depth of the place of foreign language
materials in the research activity of the academic community
.A
Hutchins, W.J.
Pargeter, L.J.
Saunders, W.L.
.W
This volume presents the results of a detailed study of the
place of foreign language materials in University research.
In the course of our investigation, we accumulated a large
amount of data on the use of published information and of
library services by research workers and academic staff.  Our
analyses have necessarily been limited by the specific aims of
the project, but we have been constantly aware that there are
many other possible analyses of the same material.  For this
reason we have endeavoured to include in the Appendix as much
of this "raw" data as possible and to provide in the text itself,
when presenting our own analyses, as much detail as possible of
the methodology and other background information necessary for
any full evaluation.

Language and Information Selected Essays on their Theory and Application
.A
Barhillel, Y.
.W
  At one time or another many authors must have faced the dilemma of
whether to gather their articles published on a certain topic and republish
them as a collection of essays or whether to rework them into an entirely
new book.  I decided in favor of the first course with regard to the articles
I had written during the last fifteen years on language and information,
in particular on the more technical and applied aspects, leaving for some
future occasion my papers on the philosophy of language.

Language and Mind
.A
Chomsky, N.
.W
  The three chapters of this book are somewhat elaborated versions of
three lectures, the Beckman lectures, that I delivered at the University
of California, at Berkeley, in January 1967.  The first is an attempt to
evaluate past contributions to the study of mind that have been been based
on research and speculation regarding the nature of language.  The second is
devoted to contemporary developments in linguistics that have a bearing on
the study of the mind.  The third is a highly speculative discussion of
directions that the study of language and mind might take in coming years.
The three lectures, then, are concerned with the past, the present, and
the future.

Development of the County Law Library
.A
Jurkins, J.
.W
  Do you know that there are 3,071 counties and parishes and 59 county 
equivalents in the United States, making a total of 3,130? 
  Do you know that only 39 states have statutory provisions for county law 
libraries?
  Do you know that seven states have no listing for county law libraries in 
the American Association of Law Libraries 1968 Directory of Law Libraries?
  Do you know that Los Angeles County, California, not only has the largest 
county law library collection in the United States, but it also has seven 
branch law libraries?
  These four questions readily point out the simple fact that the growth and 
development of county law libraries in the United States has been uneven, 
without pattern or standards, not only on a State-to-State basis, but on a 
county- to-county basis within a particular state.   A survey of the 39 state 
statutes relating to county law libraries reveals that there are no two states 
that have exactly the same method for the establishment, administration, 
financial support, or maintenance of a county law library.

No Special Rules for Entry of Serials
.A
Carpenter, Michael
.W
   One of the objectives of a library catalog is to enable one to determine
what books or publications by an author are in the library.. Establishment
of special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of
authorship defeats this objective.. The present rule 6 of the Anglo_American
Cataloging Rules are the Paris Principles are criticized in this regard.. In the
course of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, the
presence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not
valid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore, 
using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials..
Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished,
that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship,
including compilations and works produced under editorial direction.. This will
have the added benefit of allowing consistent treatment of instances of 
corporate and personal authorship..

Periodicals for the Small Bio-Medical and Clinical Library
.A
Hunt, J.W.
.W
    Since the advent of periodical literature in the seventeenth
century well over ten thousand journals have been published in
the field of bio-medicine.  Many of these have ceased publication;
others are only of local interest.  Still, approximately two 
thousand desirable periodicals in this field are being currently
released.  As research and discovery are recorded in the journal
literature, the greatest asset of a scientific library is its
subscription list and periodical holdings.  It therefore becomes
a major responsibility of such libraries to make this wealth of
experimental data available to their readers.  When funds are
limited, the selection of a periodical collection that will best
serve the most urgent needs of the reader becomes of paramount
importance.  A plan of highly selective purchasing must be adopted
to prevent the improper use of funds.  Actual needs of the library
must be at hand to carry out such a plan.

Libraries at Large
.A
Knight, D.M.
.W
    This book, Libraries at Large, is itself one tangible outcome of Advisory 
Commission activity, representing the combined efforts of Duke University,
the R.R. Bowker Company, members of the Commission and its several study
groups, and many other diverse individuals within and without the library
world.  The resultant theme is the same one that characterized the work of
our Commission from the beginning - namely, a concern that every individual
in our society be provided with library and informational services adequate
to his current and emerging needs.  Confronting this goal requires a
recognition of inevitable change, and we have questioned status quo, 
recognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisite
for the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change.  The
national interest demands simultaneous sympathy with people in pockets of
illiteracy and people in the vanguards of intellectual achievement.

Libraries and Librarianship in the West: A Brief History
.A
Jackson, S.L.
.W
  This book was written in an attempt to fill a gap.  If one ignored the major
historical resources in other languages (which few United States students read),
notably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau and
others (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it was
plain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamental
needs.  The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson's A
History of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in
its second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues
as announced to cover only libraries.  Its attention to librarianship is very
limited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned.  Furthermore,
the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of
crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the
development of the image of the library and librarian.  The aim here has been
to tie it all together.
  In the present offering, "the West" is used conventionally: European 
civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere
progeny.  The limitation is practical.  To try to "cover" even the West may
prove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.  Yet an
understanding of those lands "beyond" would be most valuable to us all.
Let us hope that someone will try to provide it.

Libraries and Neighborhood Information Centers
.A
Kromes, C.L.
.W
  It has been suggested by various librarians concerned with inner-city
service that the library serve as an informational and interpersonal link
between community residents and social agencies.  The major question is
whether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdened
social service bureaucracy.  The rationale for envisioning the library in
this role is twofold:  (1) the library has achieved a reputation for
impartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue and
is not committed to any particular action program, community service or
clientele; and (2) librarians are specifically trained to locate, organize,
update and disseminate information.

Libraries and the Organization of Knowledge
.A
Shera, J.H.
.W
  From time to time, in the course of its historical development, a
professional activity enters a new stage.  This usually takes place as the
culmination of a series of modifications to the practice of the art, arising
out of changes in the social situation in which the profession operates.
Skilled workers, sensitive to changing needs, alter or refine their practice
so that it develops in tune with the progress of society itself.  Descriptive
accounts of new or improved methods appear in the literature; and, from
time to time, a leading thinker makes a new synthesis by combining these
explanations into a system, or theory, which gives a rational account
of what is going on, and so prepares the way forward.
  This is what Dean Jesse H. Shera has set out to do in this collection of
his essays and addresses.

  Although catalogue codes and standards have received much attention, there 
has been very little fundamental questioning of cataloguing principles and 
practice.  Basic questions in need of investigation include: whether individual 
libraries need catalogues of their own stock; how far printed  bibliographies
could serve as a substitute; the functions catalogues are serving at present, 
and the actual demands placed on them; the nature of users and non-users, and 
the possible conflicts between the catalogue needs of librarians and 
non-librarians; the psychological factors of approachability and usability; 
whether standardization should over-rule local needs; whether catalogues
should be designed for use by readers at all; the functions of printed national 
catalogues; the implications of increased co-operation and of the changing 
functions of libraries; what a catalogue entry should contain and how it
should be arranged; and the possible administrative uses of catalogue data.  
Mechanization has made these questions of great urgency.

Library Automation:  Experience, Methodology, and Technology of the Library 
as an Information System
.A
Heiliger, E.M.
.W
  The goal of this book, Library Automation: Experience, Methodology,
and Technology of the Library as an Information System, is to
provide a perspective of the library functions that have been or
might be mechanized or automated, an outline of the methodology
of the systems approach, an overview of the technology available to
the library, and a projection of the prospects for library automation.
  There is a concern in every library for the proper handling and
control of a veritable flood of material and for the prompt and
convenient fulfillment of service demands.  That concern is matched by
excitement about the possibilities for effective use of the computers
and communications network in many library functions.  Knowledge,
the library's stock-in-trade, is being generated at an unprecedented
rate and sought after with unprecedented intensity.  Technology, the
driving force behind the library's problems and one hope for future
solution, is being advanced to unprecedented levels.

Library Automation Systems
.A
Salmon, S.R.
.W
    This book is intended as a reasonably comprehensive discussion
of library automation systems for the librarian without previous
knowledge or experience in the field, and for the intelligent layman.
Library automation systems, in the context of this work, are 
combinations of electronic data processing machines and appropriate
programs and operating procedures, organized to work together in
carrying out, with a minimum of human intervention, some well-defined
library process.  It is a field that many thoughtful observers feel
has reached a certain maturity, and so deserves to have its portrait
made.

  The book was built on interviews with the Library's middle

various divisions, on conversations with and questionnaires
sent to out-of-Library users, and from my own observations
through almost twenty-five years in the Library's Congressional
Research Service.  After the text was completed, it was read
by appropriate people in each department for factual content
and ultimately by the staff in the Librarian's Office for
their comment.  At no point was there pressure to change text
or conclusions - although there were plenty of good-natured
suggestions on details, and nearly everyone urged a fuller
description of his own particular specialty!

ISBD(S) and Title Main Entry for Serials
.A
Spalding, C. S.
.W
  The International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts,
convened in Copenhagen in 1969 under the auspices
of the IFLA Committee on Uniform Cataloguing
Rules (later Committee on Cataloguing), set in
motion the first major development in continuation
of the success achieved by the Paris International
Conference on Cataloguing Principles (1961) in the
matter of the principles and general rules for entry
and heading.  Taking under consideration the study of
"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries"
prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of
the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with
Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an
international standard bibliographic description for
monographic publications.  There was common
agreement that the objective was the development of
specifications for the necessary data elements, their
order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit
them.  These specifications should be designed to
satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and,
with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable,
the needs of the libraries of the entire world.  It was
further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions
were to be made quite independently of the heading
under which they might appear in listings.  The working
group succeeded in its task and brought forth its
provisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard
edition was published earlier this year.  The success of
this standard is manifested by the continuing increase
in the number of countries that have adopted it.

Main Entry for Serials

Howard, J.H.

  The nature of serials is such that, in both the ALA Cataloging Rules for 
Author and Titles Entries and the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR),there
are special rules for choice of entry for serials that differ from the rules for 
monographs.  While the Statement of Principles Adopted at the International
Conference on Cataloging Principles (Paris Principles) leaves much room for 
interpretation and controversy regarding serials, it also provides for special 
rules for choice of entry.

  The final report from the Association of Research Libraries' ad hoc Committee 
on Machine-Based Serials, written in January of this year, showed that of the 
86 libraries which participated in the  committee's survey of efforts in the 
area of machine-readable serials files, 64 had files containing a total of
1,723,568 titles.  Twenty-two libraries reported having no files and one library 
indicated that it was in the process of converting its file.  The cost of
converting these files is approximately $1,500,000, not to mention the 
utilization of an incredible amount of duplicate conversion effort.

    The major conclusions and recommendations of the study which follows are:
  That the catalogs of The Research Libraries of the New York Public Library be
divided chronologically at the earliest possible date;
  That the present (or retrospective) Public Catalog be reproduced 
photographically in book form;
  That the future (or prospective) catalogs be produced in a combination of 
card and book form from a store of machine-readable data;
  That a Central Serial Record be created to contain acquisition information, 
cataloging and holdings data, and bindery records for all serial publications 
in The Research Libraries.

Library Education: an introductional survey
.A
Bone, L.E.
.W
        Social structures have changed more quickly during
    the last one hundred years than during any other equivalent
    period in history.  With these changes have come alternations
    in the role of institutions of higher education.  During
    the Centennial Year we shall try to measure the need and
    nature of further change and to evolve ideas that may
    influence its direction.

    In keeping with this idea, the Graduate School of Library Science
of the University of Illinois felt that this indeed was a time propitious
for holding an International Conference on Education for Librarianship.
The profession as a whole and library education in particular are still
quite young, but in less than one hundred years we have seen revolutionary
changes.  Demands have been made on the world's libraries, and in turn on
the schools' training personnel for these libraries, almost too rapidly
for them to satisfy.  It seemed logical for library education, therefore,
"to measure the need and nature of future change and to evolve ideas that
may influence its direction."

Library Education and Training
.A
Bonn, G.S.
.W
    The Conference on Library Education and Training in
Developing Countries was arranged in order (1) to examine
more closely the present facilities, curricula, and programs
for training library workers in the developing countries
of the world closest to Hawaii, those in East and South
Asia; (2) to determine their short- and long-range needs
for trained library workers; and (3) to determine their
needs for additional library education and training facilities
and for revised curricula.  In the light of this information
the Conference proposed to evaluate the assistance given
in recent years by American advisors and temporary library school 
faculty in these countries, and then to ascertain the roles
that both local library schools and their counterparts in the
United States can play in serving the needs for trained
library workers in these and other developing countries.

Library Effectiveness
.A
Morse, P.M.
.W
  This book is an experiment - in several respects.  The pressures of
rising publication, together with the dazzling potentialities of the
electronic computer, are forcing librarians to think more quantitatively
about their libraries than most of them ever have before and, 
simultaneously, have aroused the interest of the computer expert and
the systems analyst in information storage and retrieval systems, of
which the library is still the most successful exemplar.

The Lending of Books to One Another by Libraries
.A
Green, S.S.
.W
  It would add greatly to the usefulness of our reference libraries if an 
agreement should be made to lend books to each other for short periods of time.
It happens not unfrequently that some book is called for by a reader, or that
in looking up the answer to a question a librarian has occasion to use a book 
which he finds in the catalogue of another library, but which does not belong 
to his own collection. The book, very likely, is one that can be replaced
if lost.  But it would take time to get it through ordinary channels; it might 
be necessary to send abroad for a copy or to wait to pick up one, if the book 
is scarce.  In such a case it would be a great convenience to be able to
borrow a book for a few days.

Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers
.A
Green, S.S.
.W
  When scholars and persons of high social position come to a library,
they have confidence enough, in regard to the cordiality of their reception, 
to make known their wishes without timidity or reserve.
  Modest men in the humbler walks of life, and well-trained boys and girls, 
need encouragement before they become ready to say freely what they want.
  A hearty reception by a sympathizing friend, and the recognition of some one 
at hand who will listen to inquiries, even although he may consider them 
unimportant,  make it easy for such persons to ask questions, and put them at 
once on a  home footing.

The Divided Catalog
.A
Elrod, J.M.
.W
  As early as 1905 the divided catalog was being presented as a preferable 
alternative to the dictionary catalog. Writing in 1958 Dorothy Grosser found
that the steady stream of papers on the subject began in 1938.  She reported 21
articles based on actual experience with the divided catalog.  A quick check of
her list discloses that all divided catalogs are not represented by articles. 
She recorded nine opponents of the divided  catalog and six better known 
members of the profession reserving judgement.  Lyle in his new edition of The 
Administration of the College Library considers it "safer," rather than "wiser" 
as in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at Central 
Methodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown its 
cabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinion
was undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be 
considered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of 
inconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filing
of subject and title entries.  The following questions were asked of all users 
of the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks:
 1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject?
    Were you looking under author, title, or subject?
 2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog?
 3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file?
  One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, were 
questioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a 
separate catalog, 5 per  cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It must 
be admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the 
way in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by the 
University of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog.

The Trading Stamp Mentality
.A
Stokes, R.
.W
  A number of trips to the United States, to teach in library schools, have
inculcated in me a variety of views about the present state of American
library education.  They are personal opinions - no more - but they come
from one who has seen much that he admires and who believes wholeheartedly
that the American spirit includes  a firm resolution to change whatever
is inefficient or corrupt.  Otherwise, 1776 would have no meaning.  The
opinions do not stem directly from my experience in the five accredited
schools in which I have taught, but are strongly rooted in my general
observation of library education practice and my discussions with 
members of the library profession.

Top Priority for Cataloging-In-Source
.A
Wheeler, J.L.
.W
  After a century of public library service and progress, public
libraries attract less than a third, perhaps only a quarter of the adult
population, either to read and borrow books, or to look up information.  
But nearly 60 per cent of the population is over 21. Currently a few large city
libraries show slight decreases in  annual circulation, the major measure
of their usefulness.  Yet, nationally, circulation and the informational use 
of public libraries have in general steadily increased, especially in the last 
decade.  Possibly  because the number of public, college, university, and 
special libraries doubled, from 13,676 reported in 1960, to 27,746 in 1968 
(Publishers' Weekly, January 20, 1969).  And there are more than that many 
school libraries.

The Urban Library Dilemma
.A
Gaines, E.J.
.W
  The American urban public library is in something of a dilemma. Relatively 
secure in the affections of the populace, the library is nevertheless
frequently threatened by loss of income. The threats are cyclical and are
associated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notably
obscure.  The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for
the libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both because
the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were
preposterously unmistakable.  In the eye of the politician who must find that 
tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the 
library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather.  In 12
years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce a
critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library.  I think the
experience is not uncommon.  Only the most extraordinary efforts keep most 
urban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive.
Periods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in the 
richest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic 
success. The paradox invites some critical self-analysis.

The Library Press
.A
Moon, E.
.W
  The deadliest disease afflicting the library press is proliferation.  The
kindest and most conservative estimate I am able to bring myself to make is
that there are at least three times as many library periodicals in this country
as we can afford or are necessary. Perhaps the most constructive single thing
that could be accomplished would be to persuade at least one in three
publishers of a library periodical to cease publication.
  One might reasonably expect that librarians, who have done so much
public wailing about the publication explosion, would be among the chief
advocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print.  Instead
we find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the king-size bed of printed 
procreation as do the denizens of the Sodom and Gomorrah of science and 
technology. Just about every library of any consequence (and some of little
consequence) and, almost without exception, every group or organization
within the loose boundaries of our  profession, decides, virtually at the
moment of its birth, that it cannot survive without a publication of its
own - a newsletter, a journal, some regular calling card to announce its 
presence to the world at large.

Library Education and the Public Library
.A
Garrison, G.
.W
  A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always
been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains
for current service instead of educating for growth and change.  Unfortunately,
the picture many faculty members have of what today's
requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete.  Graduates 
are thus doubly handicapped.  Not only do we fail to educate, we fail
even to provide realistic training.  At worst, we perpetuate the past and
train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public
libraries.   Library education, like the public
library itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of
oblivion.  Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position
of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive.  Others will wither
away, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies.  There is no
shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for
graduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both.
An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called "Dust Gathers
on the Public Library" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline and
loss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter is
dead - while the public library lives on).

Crisis in Library Education

Bundy, M.L.

  A battle is currently being waged at the University of Maryland School
of Library and Information Services; its outcome will influence the future
of the library profession.  Because of the significance of this controversy,
this situation at Maryland is here brought to the attention of the
profession at large.   Last fall, a group, with funding
from the Office of Education, brought into being an educational
program which is addressing the profession's most critical problems,
those central to its survival as a viable social institution:  The library
profession's need to define and fulfill an important service function in the
public arena; its failure to make itself relevant to other than middle-class
interests in the culture; and its inavailability to contribute to the
alleviation of the severe social, economic, and other inequalities which exist 
in the culture and which continue to deprive black Americans particularly of 
even minimal life opportunities.

The Philadelphia Project
.A
Benford, J.Q.
.W
  The objectives of the research were: 1) to determine actual requirements for
library resources by elementary and secondary grade students and to
evaluate existing library resources in terms both of student needs and national
standards, and 2) on the basis of this information to outline the respective
roles of the school libraries and the public libraries in providing needed
resources and in developing joint planning.

Library Cost Analysis:  A Recipe
.A
Kountz, J.
.W
  Unforgivably, time has passed since the days when the library's patron was
the local monarch and cost was no deterrent.  Time's passage has replaced the
monarch with taxpayers or stockholders, and, concurrently, sensitivity to cost 
has attained stellar importance.   The causes for being unaware of costs
may stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to the 
profession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost 
accounting. What is suspected is a lack of the few
simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in
short - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis.
  In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related
procedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success
over the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents the 
findings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of 
your own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate 
requirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the 
six steps and five resource requirements which follow.  In addition to 
identifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis, 
these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful 
for your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future.

The Paradoxes of Library Cooperation
.A
Dougherty, R.M.
.W
  The need for libraries to cooperate has long been recognized, as countless
articles written within the past decade will attest.  Moreover, the necessity to
combine forces has never been as apparent as it is today.  Because the cost of 
self-sufficiency has become undeniably prohibitive, libraries can no longer 
afford to act as free agents.  Voluntary library
cooperation is no natural manifestation of social interaction.  Rhetoric alone 
is a impotent agent of change.  In truth, cooperative programs succeed only 
as long as each participant perceives the arrangement as beneficial to his
institution.

ISBD
Its Origin, Rationale, and Implications
.A
Spaulding, C.S.
.W
  A proper understanding of the International Standard Bibliographic
Description (ISBD), a standard promulgated by the International Federation of
Library Associations (IFLA), requires some knowledge of how it came into
existence, what reasoning prompted its development, ad what useful results can 
be expected from its adoption.  These matters will be dealt with below,
hopefully in sufficient detail to provide readers with a basis for teaching a 
sound evaluation of the effect of this standard when applied to American 
cataloging practice and in particular to LC cataloging and MARC tapes.

ISBD Standard or Secret?
.A
Swanson, G.
.W
  The controversial ISBD will mean radical changes in descriptive cataloging
practice if put into operation, as planned, by the Library of Congress.
Users of LC catalog cards will require retraining: all reference librarians 
will experience an immediate and continuing demand for explanation of the 
new catalog cards to users; those large public and research libraries with 
computer-based systems will require costly modifications of computer programs.
Yet the ISBD (International Standard Bibliographic Description) is destined 
to be implemented by the Library of Congress with the sanction of ALA but 
without even being considered by the recognized standards associations (ISO, 
ANSI), to say nothing of the other professional and information industry 
organizations.

Pay Libraries & User Charges
.A
De Gennaro, R.
.W
  The battle lines are being drawn for a great debate
over the emotionally and politically charged issue of how library
and information services are to be funded in the coming decades.
Most librarians will be on the side of "conservatism" and "democracy,"
favoring the continuation of traditional modes of tax-supported public
library service with information freely available to all
as a matter of right.  Information industry people, publishers,
government officials, engineers, and even, perhaps, authors will be
on the side of "progress" and "profits," advocating a new concept of
for-profit or pay libraries, user charges, and information as a salable 
commodity.

Austerity, Technology, and Resource Sharing: Research Libraries Face the Future
.A
De Gennaro, R.
.W
  During the last two decades academic libraries, in
parallel with their parent institutions, experienced the
greatest period of growth and affluence that they have
ever known.  The watchword was "more" - more money,
more books and journals, more staff, more space, and
more technology.  Many new research libraries were
created, and those that already existed experienced
unprecedented growth.  Although libraries got more of
everything during those years, they still could not keep pace
with the growth of new fields of research, new doctoral
programs, and the increasing production of books and
journals.  Two decades of affluence not only failed to help
solve the many problems that were brought on by
exponential growth - they exacerbated them.

Gore, D.

     A funny thing happened on the way
to the biggest building boom in library
history.  Book collections grew faster
than the new space to hold them, so when
the boom was over the aggregate space
problem of academic libraries was a little
worse than it was at the beginning.
     During the roughly eight-year span
of the rise and fall of the boom, some 570
new or expanded library buildings sprang
up on the campuses of four-year and
graduate institutions around the nation.

A Library Management Game: a report on a research project
.A
Brophy, P.
.W
    Although the use of games in professional education has
become widespread only during the last decade, the method has
been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years.
Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in
military training when the "real thing" was either unavailable
or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have
become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large
electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved.
Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was
introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a
wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels
of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced
men and women.  One of the main causes of this "game explosion" has been
the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such
as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible
by rapid advances in computer technology.

Library Materials
.A
Lyman, H.H.
.W
  The problem investigated by the research was the development
of standards for reading materials that would support the adult
new reader in the exercise of his new-found skill and build the habit
of regular use of the printed word.  Bridging the gap between minimal
literacy skills and the reading habit was proposed as essential
to the purposes of the library program in helping the reader improve
has basic education skills, increase his employability, and develop
his potential as a citizen and gain personal satisfaction in his
many adult roles.  The nature of library materials best designed
for this end required study in depth.  The findings and conclusions
derived from the research project provide basic information about the
adult new reader and his reading, criteria for analysis of reading
materials, and a bibliography of materials.  These products of the
study constitute a series of reading selection and guidance aids for
use by all persons working in this area of service -- librarians,
community workers, teachers, publishers, editors, and reading
specialists.

Library Networks
.A
Goldstein, S.
.W
    The combination of computers and communications technology
is a development whose time has come for libraries in the U.S.
    And despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting
the new technology for its use, libraries are now rapidly
expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to
disseminate ever-expanding amounts of information in more
effective ways.
    It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the
library's function is to parcel out information, and that
information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can
be mailed.
    In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone
is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts,
state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes
Xerox and International Business Machines.  Their initial efforts
are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in
particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions.  The Ohio college
Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries
for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and
most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely
copied by the others.

Library Planning and Decision Making Systems
.A
Hamburg, M.
.W
  The research project which produced this book concentrated on the problem
of the design and development of statistical information systems that would
provide quantitative information for effective management of university and
large public libraries.  Since there is an inseparable need not only for
improved library statistical data systems but also for the above-mentioned
frameworks for rational planning and decision making, we have devoted
considerable effort to the development of analytical models that might assist
library administrators in making decisions that would maximize the flow of
benefits imparted to the communities the library serves.  Some of the results of
this model-building effort are repored in these pages.

Library Practice in Hospitals
.A
Bloomquist, H.
.W
  According to a National Hospital Panel Survey conducted by the American
Hospital Association in February 1970, 4,191 (72 percent) of the 5,820
community hospitals in the United States operated a library.  This percentage
falls to 60 when only hospitals of less than 100-bed capacity are considered
(1,990 libraries in 3,318 hospitals).  In the 4,191 libraries, one or more
full-time staff members were found in only 1,054 (25 percent).  In even
fewer, 928, was there supervision of the library by a professional librarian.
Clearly there is a massive job to be done if these libraries are to perform
properly their functions of health education and patient care.
  By "community hospital" we mean the nonfederal, short-term hospital
providing general and selected special services, the hospital located at some
distance from a large medical center and without teaching and research
programs, such as a nursing school or internships.  Though the librarians
of more sophisticated teaching institutions may well profit from the study
of this book, it is written primarily for an audience of untrained, probably
newly employed, individuals who find themselves supervising the hospital's
library and do not know where to begin.

The Crisis in Cataloging
.A
Osborn, A.D.
.W
  A wise German librarian has linked the library administrator
and the cataloger as working for the common aim of economy
in work and cost coupled with better utilization of a library's
resources.  This aim, he thinks, is expressed in various kinds of 
cooperative work, of pooling interests, and of setting standards.
It is to be developed prudently, he says, with the objectives
setting limitations in such a way that more values will not be
destroyed than are created.
  This ideal he set out in a chapter entitled "Tasks for the
future."  There was a time, and not so very far back, when the
library administrator and the cataloger worked side by side.  In
the more immediate past, however, the two have become separated,
so that their closer collaboration does need to be set down
as a task for the future, the immediate future at that.
Many new problems of administration have served to busy the
administrator, and most catalogers have had more work than
enough, with the result that administrators have come to know
less and less of cataloging, and catalogers have come to know
less and less about general library administration.  The situation
now is that the administrator will be forced to pay more
attention to cataloging because it has become a major problem
field.

The Historical Background of Departmental and Collegiate Libraries
.A
Thompson, L.
.W
  In spite of the great volume of material dealing with
departmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared in
library periodicals and books on university and college
library administration, there has been relatively little original
thought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment to
provide an adequate background for solution of problems which
have their roots in a former generation.  Most of the literature
has been either repetition of the old arguments for and against
this type of library organization or statements of how this or
that institution has faced its peculiar problems.  Except for
contemporary accounts of early American scholars describing the
attempts to transplant the German seminar library to American
soil and reports on a few large university libraries, there is no
account of the conditions which brought about and for many
years invigorated the departmental system.  An evaluation of
trends in the history of departmental libraries over the last
three-quarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplement
to other information in the hands of surveyors and administrators
who are interested in abolishing, establishing, continuing, or
amalgamating departmental libraries in a given institution.

Characteristics of the Research Literature Used by Chemists
and Physicists in the United States
.A
Fussler, H.H.
.W
  The increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural
consequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of 
knowledge. Librarians have tried to amass more and
more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of
their clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in the
increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The 
processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have 
become increasingly complex and expensive.  The processes
are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library
is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its
predecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries
that is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished
from the costs of its purchase or its direct
servicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when
nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing
material, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!

  This is the second of two papers dealing with the characteristics of the
literature used by research chemists and physicists in the United States.  
The method of the study was fully outlined in th first article and will
therefore not be repeated here.   The previous paper was devoted to a
discussion of the importance of the literature of various subject fields to
research in chemistry and physics.  The remarks that follow are directed
primarily to a discussion of the temporal span of the literature, the principal
forms of the literature, the national origins of the literature used in the 
United States, and some attention is devoted to the more important serial
titles.

The Librarian:  From Occupation to Profession?
.A
Goode, W.J.
.W
  An industrial society has an open class stratification system; it
offers some an opportunity to rise, but it offers no guarantee against
downward social mobility.  Compared to other types of societies, this one
demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much
pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual 
in his original caste or class.  Much of the resulting mobility is based on a 
radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern
industrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists 
anticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills 
of a high order.
  Thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to
rise in the class system, but occupations, too, are engaged in the same 
competition and may move up or down in power, prestige, or income.

Interrelations among Special Librarys
.A
Budington, W.S.
.W
  The present paper will first deal with some of the objectives, etiology, and
requirements of the library network as it overtakes and embraces co-operation.
Next, in this context of network development, a number of activities
involving special libraries will be reviewed by way of illustration and 
example.  The greatest proportion of special library interrelationships are,
on the surface at least, random and  informal.  We shall therefore concentrate
on such arrangements as have about them some measure of structure and intent.
Finally, we will deduce from these examples the performance and promise
which special libraries may offer to a total library network or information 
system.

The Cranfield II Relevance Assessments: A Critical Evaluation
.A
Harter, Stephen P.
.W
   The relevance assessments belonging to the Cranfield II document/query
collection are shown to be faulty, in the sense that "many" relevant documents
were not so identified by the Cranfield judges.. The implications of these
omissions for the evaluation of information retrieval experiments based on the
Cranfield collection are examined in detail..It is shown that numerical measures
of retrieval effectiveness may be greatly altered bu consideration of the 
"missing" relevant documents and that a ranking  of retrieval methods according 
to order of performance may vary as well..

An Economic Analysis of Library Benefits
.A
Goddard, Haynes C.
.W
   Libraries find it increasingly necessary to use their limited resources in the
most efficient manner.. This requires the use of decision rules which permit 
library resources to be directed to those activities which yield the highest 
returns.. An effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest
which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society..
   An evaluation of the traditional library functions of education, information,
and leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward 
educational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are 
involved.. A case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of 
school-age children, other explicitly involved in education, disadvantages 
minority groups and governmental officials and staff..
   Since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same
services, it is an uneconomic use of the communities' resources to maintain two
separate institutions, one of which imposes costs on the other as children are 
forced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies..

The Review Article: Its Characteristics and Problems
.A
Virgo, Julie A.
.W
   The characteristics and problems associated with the review literature in the
sciences were examined.. Three major classes of review articles were identified:
(1) the annual review which aims to provide a systematic record of the 
contributions made within the previous year, (2) the critical review which 
selectively evaluates contributions to the solution of a common research problem,
and (3) data compilations which are concerned with facts and findings rather 
than the opinions of the authors of papers from which the data are taken.. The
role and control of the review article in medicine was described.. Over the
past fifteen years, the ratio of review to nonreview articles in medicine has 
been on the order of 1:38.. Possible solutions to a number of problems associated
with the review literature are discussed, such as the selection of articles for 
review..Further examination of some critical questions relating to the production
and organization of reviews will have to be undertaken before the review, as a
means of bringing the most significant information to its users, will be 
accepted as a reliable adjunct to the original publications..

Measures of Library Effectiveness
.A
Morse, Philip M.
.W
   Mathematical models of library operations are presented, allowing managers to
estimate measures of effectiveness for a library.. These models describe the
amount of use made of resources by a user in a visit, the distribution of book
circulation in a collection, the dependence of circulation on time, and the 
effect of multiple copies on user satisfaction.. Predictions are made on the 
basis of the models of the consequence of breaking of central library into 
branch libraries.. The effect, in terms of frustrated use, of removing the 
least-used books from a collection is discussed, as are strategies for for
duplication.. The emphasis is on facilitating getting results from models; for
this purpose graphic techniques supplement the mathematical formulas..

Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F.
.W
  This article begins with a discussion of the broad role of operations research
(O.R.) in a society undergoing change.. The nature of O.R. terms in a library 
environment is then considered.. The function of models in O.R. is analyzed, the
development of a model being contrasted with its formal presentation.. Criteria
for good models are suggested.. This article then focuses on storage models for 
libraries, first considering the Dewey classification system from this 
perspective and then summarizing more current research carried out under the 
direction of the author with a grant from the National Science Foundation..

An Operations Research Study of a Variable Loan and Duplication Policy 
at the University of Lancaster
.A
Buckland, Michael K.
.W
   The Library Research Unit of the University of Lancaster used an Operations
Research (O.R.) approach to recommend changes in loan and duplication policies 
in the university library.. The "variable" loan and duplication policy which was
developed is described and also the considerable impact of implementation.. 
Other libraries are now adopting this kind of policy.. The work is presented as 
a case study in library O.R. .. The great importance of analyzing the structure
of problems is stressed and the nature and usefulness of models is described..
For the most useful results, suitable librarians should be included in the
research team..

Library Objectiveness and Performance Measures and Their Use in Decision 
Making
.A
Hamburg, Morris

Ramist, Leonard E.

Bommer, Michael R. W.
.W
   For optimal allocations of limited funds, it is necessary for libraries to 
develop measures of output.. Various forms of user exposure to documents are
discussed in an effort to develop such measures for public libraries.. It is
suggested that the actual method of accounting  be used to compare such measures
with costs, and an illustrative computation is presented.. It is shown how size 
of user population, amount of exposure, and costs for a given year can be 
estimated..Similar techniques are suggested for evaluation of library programs..
This approach is then compared with current concepts of library standards.. The
paper concludes with suggestions for further research..

Catalog use in a Large Research Library
.A
Lipetz, Ben_Ami
.W
   Concern with the questions of when and how best to computerize the catalog of
a large research library, and how to improve an existing conventional catalog, 
motivated a study of the utilization of the main catalog of the Yale University 
Library.. The study was carefully designed to provide a representative sample of
catalog use.. Traffic through the catalog area was observed over a period of more
than a year.. A schedule of interviews with catalog users was based on observed 
traffic volume by hour of day, day of week, and time of year.. More than 1,000 
interviews were completed, using nonleading interviewing technique.. Information
was derived on the catalog user's objective, starting clues, and university
affiliation.. Search success was determined.. Follow-up studies were performed 
on the catalog cards and the actual books identified in successful searches.. 
Reasons for search failure were determined for know-item searches.. Availability
and accuracy of different categories of search clues were ascertained.. Published
algorithms for searching computerized bibliographic files were evaluated.. 
Attention is given to the feasibility of automatic construction of computerized 
catalogs.. Some of the available results are presented and discussed..

Efficiency Criteria for the Operation of Large Libraries
.A
Meier, R.L.
.W
  It is rather surprising that behavioral scientists have not discovered 
libraries much sooner in their search for institutional environments suited for
the testing of theoretical hypotheses. Librarians and their assistants respect 
research and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty in 
helping the investigator, even when they are skeptical (rightfully, in most 
instances) of the usefulness of such research for the
improvement of their own organizations.
Data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision and
discipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices; 
therefore, significant results can often be obtained
with smaller samples and in shorter periods
of observation.  People working in libraries do not feel they should curtail
disclosures about basic processes.  Elsewhere professional employees are 
obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitors
or to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislative
committees.  At least as important to an investigator is the fact that one or 
more libraries almost always lie close at hand - there could hardly be any 
more convenient institution.

The Information Needs of Current Scientific Research
.A
Menzel, H.
.W
       The information demands, or information needs, of current scientific
research are similar in many respects to the information needs in
other forms of scholarship.  But this is not true in all cases, and the focus 
of this paper is on the needs of the research scientists.  In discussing the
information needs of the scientist, I shall not limit myself to those for
which library work is immediately relevant; in fact, a good part of this
paper will call attention to the importance of those aspects of scientific
communication that take place outside libraries and, indeed, outside 
literature. (There are, of course, very few aspects of scientific communication 
to which library work is not at least indirectly relevant.)

The Evidence Underlying the Cranfield Results
.A
Swanson, D.R.
.W
  An indexing or classification system should be judged by the retrieval 
results it produces, namely, the extent to which it brings
forth relevant material and rejects the
irrelevant.  Thus, well-designed experiments should permit judging the relative
merits of different classification schemes. This notion, although self-evident, 
had remarkably little impact on the field of
library science prior to the 1950's.  During that decade, the first controlled
experiments on information retrieval were performed, and these mark a turning
point in the history of classification research.  For the first time, 
experimental procedure and the rules of scientific evidence became of critical 
importance to indexing and classification. It is my purpose here to review some
aspects of the most notable of these experimental tests - the ASLIB
Cranfield Research Project.

On Improving Communication among Scientists
.A
Swanson, D.R.
.W
  Libraries and information services of the twenty-first century almost 
certainly will be the beneficiary, or perhaps the victim, of enormous 
technological change. High-speed search by computers, microrecording 
techniques, remote interrogation consoles, and great communication networks
will someday place the world's knowledge at our fingertips.  It is inferred
by many that, through such a metamorphosis, we shall cure the
information ills of our age, bring order out of chaos, and somehow contain the
"information explosion" - or at least reduce it to a small conflagration.

  The Information Systems Office (ISO) of the Library of Congress has as its 
mission the development and implementation of the main automation
program for the Library and the co-ordination of all LC automation efforts.  
One of the primary activities in this effort is a system-development
study concentrating on the central bibliographic operations, that is, 
acquisitions, cataloging, reference, etc.  This study is now in its early
stages, and it is too soon to predict the actual system that will evolve.  
As an adjunct to this study an analysis of the potential uses of and
problems involved in the machine processing of cataloging data was begun.  One 
aspect of the analysis was the design of a preliminary machine-
readable catalog record.  The results of this work are in a report issued by 
the ISO as its "Planning Memorandum Number 3."

networks.. The basic concepts from graph theory are illustrated with the aid of 
a hypothetical Public Library Access Network (PLAN)..

The Divided Catalog: A Summary of the Literature
.A
Grosser, D.
.W
  In the earliest item (1905) in the bibliography here presented, Fletcher
challenges the right of the dictionary catalog to be the overwhelmingly
predominant type of catalog in libraries.  He questions its advocates' claim
that it best meets a library's needs.  He advocates a divided catalog such as
the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog
can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject
fields.  We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography
(Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more
than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject
of the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably some
divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the
greatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of the
literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year
in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began.

the cost of ordering, as part of the total acquisition process.  We also
attempted to get indirect costs, such as rent and utilities.  Very few of
the libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on direct
cost only.  We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics
were extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in the
libraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarian
performing most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedingly
high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion.

Why Allocate?

Bach, H.

  Most academic librarians will no doubt agree with Lyle's
statement that the book fund is one of the most important items
in the library budget.  Fewer academic librarians, however, are likely to
agree with the view that in their handling of the book budget, college
and university librarians for the most part have not been living up to
their professional responsibilities.

Cost Accounting for the Library
.A
Brutcher, C.
Gessford, G.
Rixford, E.
.W
  Increasingly, librarians have felt the need for more accurate cost
data.  The prime reason for this need has been in the development
and presentation of the budget which is the instrument used to determine
and obtain the funds for the library's forthcoming fiscal period.
Since libraries do not charge for the service they render their users,
they must derive the funds necessary for their operations and growth from
supporting bodies such as federal, state, or local governments, private
institutions, and industrial firms.

A Study of the Usage and Retention of Technical Periodicals
.A
Strain, P.M.
.W
  Limited physical space expansion, an administrative
consideration in every library, becomes a stringent factor in the planning
of special libraries.  While public and college libraries may have  
several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a
building or area, it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are
not overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters.  Industrial
floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the
possible future growth of the library.	Weeding or storage requirements,
therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial
library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of
libraries.  The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the
serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current
technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals. 
These collections grow rapidly.  This summarization of a recent study made
by one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journals
has potential for other libraries.

Remarks on LC Plans for Implementation of New Centralized Acquisitions and
Cataloging Program under Title IIC, Higher Education Act
.A
Cronin, J.w.
.W
  The general purpose of my part in this program discussion is to report
to you on the new program of centralized acquisitions and cataloging
to be undertaken by the Library of Congress under authorization
granted under Title IIC of the Higher Education Act of 1965.  By this
action, the Congress took two most important steps to aid libraries of
higher education in the United States: (1) it fully recognized for the
first time, the importance of granting Federal aid and assistance toward
solving the problem of cataloging in this country; and (2) it gave the
Library of Congress a clear mandate to provide new and unparalleled
services for the benefit of academic and research libraries of this country.

Automated Acquisitions Procedures at the University of Michigan Library
.A
Dunlap, C.
.W
  In June 1965, the Acquisitions Department of The University of
Michigan Library began using a computer-based system for ordering
books and other library materials.  This is the beginning of an over-all
automated system for the Acquisitions Department and was designed
with the assistance of Robert O. Kindt, Systems Analyst from the
University's Office of Management Services.  Preliminary work on the
automated system was begun in late 1963, and in September, 1964.  Mr.
Kindt was assigned to the University Library on a full-time basis.  After
the preliminary proposal was drafted, cost and feasibility studies were
made.  Current (i.e., 1964) volume and costs were compared with anticipated
volume and costs in 1968 and 1975 for both manual and automated systems.

Facsimile Transmission in Libraries:  A State of the Art Survey
.A
Schatz, S.
.W
  Facsimile transmission is the rapid transmission of printed
pages from one point to another using electronic devices.  All facsimile 
transmission methods require converting the original picture into
an electrical impulse which is then transmitted over telephone lines,
private lines, microwave, or a combination of these communication
links.  The receiving unit reconverts the electrical impulse into an exact
duplicate of the original document on a screen or in the form of a hard
copy.

Statistics of Collection Overlap at the Libraries of the Six New
England State Universities
.A
Nugent, W.R.
.W
  As part of a design study to specify a regional processing
center for the New England state university libraries, it was
required to know the percentage of collection overlap with respect to
each of the 30 ordered pairs of 6 libraries.  Participating states were
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
Connecticut.  This overlap data was needed to predict the degree of
joint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency of
collective reclassification.
  The results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections,
showing, for example, that a random title from one library had 
a 40% chance of being present in another randomly selected library.
When current imprint samples were tested, the figure rose to 47%.
Rhode Island's holdings were shown to be the collection of greatest
duplication elsewhere.

Logical Flow Charts and Other New Techniques for the Administration

Gull, C.D.

  The widespread introduction of electronic digital computer
systems for information processing has produced significant
advances in management theory and practice in recent years.
For example, two management devices, PERT and CPM, undeveloped 
and impractical before computers, have been basic to the success
of our outer space program.  It is perhaps overlate in library
development, but appropriate in this memorial to Miss Esther J.
Piercy, to explore the application of new management knowledge
and practice to the administration of libraries and information
centers, and to sketch some directions in which research could be
undertaken to benefit the management of information.

  Growing library collections have focused attention upon the need for selective
storage and weeding of the materials..Certain objective measures for determining
which items in a collection may be retired to storage are presented, and an 
example of the use of such measures at Columbia University is described.. It is 
concluded that the criteria for weeding and storage must be selected on the basis
of the goals of the institution in question and of the various patterns of use 
in different disciplines..

Cost Analysis Studies in Libraries: Is There a Basis for Comparison?
.A
Dougherty, R.M.
.W
  When the Chairman of the Technical Services Cost Committee asked
the three of us to summarize the findings of the Colorado study on
centralized processing, I agreed.  Later, I began to have second 
thoughts - I suppose because we were almost buried under an 
avalanche of data and it soon became apparent that we could not
really summarize the findings of the study in one evening.
  The investigation took off in tangents that had not been originally
anticipated.  As you have already been informed, the final report deals
with such diverse topics as a faculty user attitude survey, mathematical
model simulations of processing center operations, approval plan
utilization, and an inter-institutional bookkeeping system, all in
addition to the cost studies of acquisitions and cataloging in nine
libraries.

The Bibliographer in the Academic Library
.A
Haro, Robert P.
.W
   Academic libraries, in their quest to secure and make available library
materials necessary to support instructional and research programs, are finding
it necessary to rely upon librarians functioning as book selectors.. The term
bibliographer (frequently applied to these selectors) is gradually taken on
new meaning in library service.. The role of the bibliographer is changing to
include (besides book selection) new duties and responsibilities such as
advanced reference, research work, instruction, and liaison duties between 
teaching departments and the library.. In addition, academic library 
organization is gradually being affected by the increasing use of 
bibliographers..

MEDLARS:  A Summary Review and Evaluation of Three Reports
.A
Stevens, N.D.
.W
  The MEDLARS (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System)
system at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has over
the past few years been one of the most significant and one of the most
publicized automated bibliographic information retrieval systems.  Over
two hundred articles on it have appeared in American newspapers and 
popular magazines, in specialized medical journals throughout the world,
and in a variety of library journals.  The publicity that has attended this
project has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an
exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only
made the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the
examination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments.  There has to date been very
little careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS.  Over 50
percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report,
and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of persons
closely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARS
system.  Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall
value cannot help but be colored by this connection.

   The history of the near-success of the 1958-59 experiment with cataloging in
source and the subsequent refusal of the library community to accept its failure
are punctuated by data from a recent survey of 591 libraries in IS categories
regarding attitudes toward prepublication cataloging..

Report on Library of Congress Plans for Cataloging in Publication
.A
Welsh, W.J.
.W
  When we were asked in October 1969 for an expression of attitude
about a renewal of cataloging-in-source, our response was positive.
We were interested and we were determined to make it succeed.  Profiting
from the experience gained in the 1958-59 experiment, we specified that:
    1. A survey of libraries be conducted;
    2. a survey of publishers be conducted;
    3. an expert investigator be secured;
    4. there must be adequate funding;
    5. there be adequate space; and,
    6. that those factors be eliminated which represented the most
       crucial problem areas in the 1958-59 experiment.

An Analysis of the Universal Decimal Classification as a Term System for 
Nuclear Science and Technology
.A
Stueart, Robert D.
.W
   Explores the possibilities of merging the terminology of the Universal
Decimal Classification System with that of a term system - Engineers Point
Council's Thesaurus - for nuclear science and technology.. Concludes, from the
evidence presented, that UDC can be effectively used as a term system.. Proposes
that the two systems coordinate the terms and merge a major thesaurus (EJC) with
an effective classification scheme of international scope (UDC) to provide a
needed tool in the area of classification and documentation..

   New filing rules have been developed for the catalogs of the Library of 
Congress to ease the tasks of filers and users and to pave the way for
computer-assisted filing.. This article discusses preliminary considerations
about the functions of large bibliographic files,the complexities of cataloging,
the interaction between users and catalogs, and ways to simplify arrangements..
The assumptions and principles that underlie the proposed rules are stated, and 
their organization and anticipated use are described.. An abridged version of 
the rules is illustrated by an extended example..

An Integrated, User-Oriented System for the Documentation and Control
of Machine-Readable Data Files
.A
Byrum, John D. Jr.

Rowen, Judith S.
.W
   The purpose of this paper is to offer a solution to the problems of 
documentation and bibliographic control of machine-readable data files.. It is a
solution which attempts to meet both the needs of the data user and the data
librarian.. It is design to make readily feasible the conversion completely or 
in part to a computer-based operation and to tie in directly to an information 
retrieval system in the future.. The four elements of this documentation and 
control system are:standard catalogue entries, data abstract and data description
forms, content documentation codebooks, and records of physical and logical 
characteristics of the data set..

Measuring Reader Failure at the Catalogue
.A
Seymour, Carol A.
.A
Schofield, J. L.
.W
   In an effort to develop a simple method for librarians to employ to measure
and evaluate author catalogue use, the Library Management Research Unit tested
a survey design in four varying libraries.. The reader was asked to note details
of items not found in the catalogue, the source of the reference, and his 
status.. The items were then checked by library staff to discover the cause of
"failure".. Library staff interviewed samples of catalogue users to determine 
the overall rate of "failure", the cooperation (with "Catalogue Query Slips") 
rate, and the action readers proposed to take in order to obtain the item(s) not
found in the catalogue..

"Early Warning" Generic Medium Designations in Multimedia Catalogues
.A
Lewis, Peter R.
.W
 The much-favored "early warning" generic medium designation is discriminatory,
functionally inefficient, and out of line with the national and international
acceptance of AACR.. A specific designation, placed with the collation, is
preferable on all these grounds; and there are better ways of giving an "early
warning"..

International Developments in Cataloging
.A
Anderson, Dorothy
.W
   The IFLA Committee on Cataloging has been at work since 1954 to establish 
international standards for cataloging and bibliographic records; it was 
responsible for the International Conference on Cataloging Principles, Paris, 
1961, and and the International Meeting of Cataloging Experts, Copenhagen, 
1969.. In recent years there have been increasing demands from national 
cataloging bodies and bibliographic agencies for uniformity in codes and 
practices, and in consequence there has been more willingness to make national 
concessions in order to reach international standards.. The IFLA Cataloging
Secretariat was established in 1971 to assist this trend by co-ordinating work,
promoting new projects and acting as a liaison center..

The Ohio College Library Center
.A
Hopkins, Judith
.W
   The Ohio College Library Center is a regional library network.. Its on-line 
shared cataloging system has been operational since 18 October 1971,and utilizes
cathode ray tube terminals located in the center's fifty-three member 
libraries.. These terminals are connected to the Sigma 5 computer in Columbus by
a multiple line, multiple party synchronous transmission telephone network.. 
Between January and June 1972 the system operated at an annual rate of 500,000 
works cataloged and over 3,400,000 catalog cards produced .. These cards are
individualized to fit the requirements of each member and are produced in packs
designated for particular catalogs..

The Other Half of Cataloging
.A
Ohmes, Frances
.A
Jones, J. F.
.W
   The authors investigate the impact of a bibliographic retrieval/card
production system, such as the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC), with special
attention to its role in cataloging.. Activities required at the local level to
make the LC card a functioning component of the catalog are described.. The
characteristics of the ensuring workload are examined, along with methods of
accomplishing it.. These activities are seen as a factor in the persistence of
backlogs.. The design of OCLC, because of the immobility of the terminal and
the absence of the catalog from the data base, by-passes this workload, leaving 
the local library to accomplish it by the method of its choice, as before, or 
to leave it undone..

    Current standards for the cataloging of serials,including the Anglo-American
Cataloging Rules, ISBD(S): International Standard Bibliographic Description for 
Serials, and the Guidelines of the International Serials Data System, are 
discussed.. The varying needs of bibliographic catalogs and serials lists, the 
latter serving primarily the functions of finding lists, are described.. A 
distinction between complete and not complete works, regardless of medium, is 
suggested as an important consideration in the revision of the Anglo-American 
Cataloging Rules..

AACR 6: Time for a Review
.A
Cole, Jim E.
.W
   Two changes are proposed in the North American text of rule 6 of the
Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR): the adoption of the British text of 6B
and the deletion of 6C.. Both of these changes are intended to simplify the
entry of serials.. With the deletion of 6C, serials would be entered only under 
title or corporate author.. The adoption of the British text od 6B would in turn
greatly simplify the remaining choice between title or corporate author..

Rules (AACR), relating to entry of serials, be replaced by the conventions for 
description of serials outlined in ISBD(S): International Standard Bibliographic
Description for Serials, which in itself incorporates (or accommodates) another 
convention, that of the "keytitle", an essential aspect of the International 
Standard Serial Number (ISSN).. Viewed in the current library context, this 
recommendation is irresponsible and indefensible on both a theoretical and
practical level..

Library Response to Urban Change; a study of the Chicago Public Library
.A
Martin, L.A.
.W
  This is the third in a series of studies of the Chicago Public Library, 
spread over fifty years.  The first (A Library Plan for the Whole
City, adopted in 1916) proposed expansion, particularly in branch units.  
The second (A Metropolitan Library in Action, completed in 1939) proposed 
quality, the achieving of recognized standards.  The underlying theme of the 
present report is adaptability, the restructuring of the Library in a period 
of change. 
  The first report, practical and pragmatic, achieved results.  The second,for 
all its internal excellence, had limited effect.  It is hoped that
the present effort partakes both of the relevance of the one and of the 
integrity of the other.

Library Systems Analysis Guidelines
.A
Chapman, E.a.

  This book aims primarily to provide guidelines for library administrators
and library systems analysts in analyzing and evaluating existing operating
systems and in designing new or improved ones.  In addition, we have
found the material to be very useful in staff training programs conducted
to ensure knowledgeable staff participation and cooperation in a systems
study.  This guide is also adaptable for introducing library school students
to the concepts of systems study in the library.

The Measurement and Evaluation of Reference Service
.A
Rothstein, S.
.W
        The measurement and evaluation of reference service
has been more often discussed than attempted.  In fact, the 
literature of this subject has itself spawned a fair-sized 
literature of review.
        Admittedly, the task is formidable.  As compared with 
other library activities such as circulation, acquisitions, and
cataloging, reference service is ill-defined, with little
agreement on its component parts.  Is inter-library lending an
integral part of reference work because many reference librarians
are responsible for it?  Formal instruction in the use of books
and libraries?  The supervision of reference reading rooms?  The
preparation of indexes?  And having decided what the genus 
"reference librarian" does, how can one readily determine the
effectiveness of his work or its impact?  Reference librarians
may have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a
problem, but it is undeniably a big one.

Service to Industry and Research Parks by College and University Libraries
.A
Nicholson, N.N.
.W
  The phrase "research parks" in the title of this article recalls
Eugene B. Jackson's 1961 prediction:

In 1980 there will be universally-managed and industry-sponsored
special libraries in the vicinity of the principal universities.  Their
advanced use of new methods of bibliographic control, information
retrieval, and data exchange will make their operations indistinguishable
from those of special libraries of outstanding profit-making organizations
in the same subject fields . . . Significant assessments will be
made on the participating organization in research parts not only for
the financing of day-to-day operations of facilities, especially set up
for their benefit, but also for the total enrichment of the university
library resources.

The Science Citation Index:
A New Concept in Indexing

Malin, M.V.
.W
  The purpose of this paper is to discuss citation indexing and its
present application as exemplified by the Science Citation Index,
published by the Institute for Scientific Information as a new, unique,
and necessary tool for scientific work.  It is necessary, therefore, to
describe briefly, and in general terms, the nature of conventional
subject indexing systems in order that a basis for contrast between these
and citation indexing can be obtained.  For those who wish to read
extensively on the subject of indexing, references are provided at the
end of the paper under the section "Additional References."

Information Network Prospects in the United States
.A
Becker, J.
.W
                Unmistakable signs are pointing the way toward
the creation sometime soon of a national information network
in the United States.  The concept of a national network implies
the interconnection of existing information systems and libraries
through communications.  Certainly one of the great strengths of this
nation is the great array of intellectual, scholarly, and research
resources to be found in its libraries and information centers.  
Without integration and close cooperation, however, these resources
will remain a series of separate, insulated institutions.  But if
maximum communication can be established among them, this array can
be converted into a national resource of immense value to citizens
throughout the country.

Standardization Requirements of a National Program
for Information Transfer

Wigington, R.L.
Wood, J.L.
.W
  The authors of this article represent two specializations in the
spectrum of information transfer activities, that of the computer and
communication system engineer and that of the librarian.  These points
of view are combined in examining the requirements for standardization
in the national efforts to use automation in publication, library,
abstracting and indexing, and information-retrieval activities.
Standardization is necessary to both the representation of information
and to the procedures being developed for handling it.

Bibliographic and Technical Problems in Implementing a National
Library Network
.A
Avram, H.D.
.W
            The problems facing the planners of automated library
networks are rooted in the complexities of organizing and managing
a vast flow of bibliographic information and its interface with
users.  Telecommunication equipment transmitting data in the form
of electric signals, electronic memories holding large stores of
information, and computers manipulating the data and graphic displays
for human interaction are technological means for performing network
functions more effectively than has been possible in the past.

The Microform Revolution
.A
Stevens, R.E.
.W
            Librarians have tried replacing some of their books
and journal files with microfilm copies or other microforms in
order to save valuable space in the bookstacks, instead of or in
addition to extension of the stack area, decentralization, compact
shelving, separate storage warehouse, or any of the other solutions
to the storage problem discussed in earlier chapters.  As a final
paper, this solution for the storage of library materials will be
discussed.  Although the distinct forms will not often be designated,
"microform" is used here to mean the four forms most common in the
United States: 35 mm. roll microfilm, microfiche (now standardized in
the United States and Great Britain at 4 by 6 inches) and the two 
micro-opaque forms - 3 by 5 inch Microcard, and 6 by 9 inch Microprint.

Participative Management as Related to Personnel Development
.A
Marchant, M.P.
.W
            Theory and practice regarding patterns of decision-
making in libraries have been relatively neglected aspects of
library administration.  Yet the decisions by which a library
attempts to control its operations are of major importance to its
welfare and effectiveness.  Recent theories in management and social
psychology have addressed themselves to the implications of 
participative management and group decision-making, and their findings 
appear to have important applications to libraries, not the least of
which is personnel development.

Numerical Methods of Bibliographic Analysis
.A
Brookes, B.C.
.W
                It is only in the last eight or ten years that the
numerical aspects of bibliography have attracted attention, although
some of the numerical regularities that occur in bibliography have been
known for thirty or forty years.  Results are, therefore, still meager
and applications are still few.  Moreover, most of the work so far 
reported has been limited to numerical analysis of the literature of the
natural sciences.  This is in part because the secondary sources in the
natural sciences are the best organized and so provide the most accessible
data; in part because the literature of the natural sciences are the least
restricted by linguistic barriers; and in part because the proposed world-
wide systems, such as those advocated in the UNISIST report, offer an
immediate field of application in the design of economic and efficient
systems based on the results of numerical bibliographic analysis.  However,
the field of possible application is gradually widening: serious efforts are
now being made to organize the more diffused literatures of the social
sciences, for example.

Evaluation of Adult Reference Service
.A
Weech, T.L.
.W
            The evaluation of reference service has received
considerable attention in the literature over a comparatively long
period.  But, as Samuel Rothstein pointed out in his 1964 Library Trends
article on the measurement and evaluation of reference service, much
of the literature has focused on discussing the lack of evaluation or
the shortcomings of the evaluation that has taken place.  In the ten years
since Rothstein wrote his article, there does seem to be more effort at
evaluation of reference service.  Undoubtedly, many of the trends in 
recent evaluation are due to the influence of Rothstein's article.

The Library's Public; a report of the public library inquiry
.A
Berelson, B.
.W
        The following report on use of the public library is
the product of two separate studies made for the Public Library
Inquiry.  One was the national sample survey of library use
made for the Inquiry by the Survey Research Center of the 
University of Michigan.  Personal interviews of a half-hour
or more in length were held with 1,151 people selected at
random in different counties scattered over the United States.
The sample was designed so as to represent all adult persons
living in private households.
    By this tested method the survey gathered information 
concerning the amount and the kind of use people make of the 
public library and what changes or extension of library
service people in general would prefer.  The survey also
gathered information on the use of books obtained from sources
other than the public library, as well as the extent of regular
use of newspapers, radio, magazines, and movies.

Determining the Optimal Number of Volumes for a
Library's Core Collection
.A
Trueswell, R.W.
.W
  The concept of the core collection in a large library is not new. The
thought behind such a concept is to provide a separation of the more
frequently used volumes from those that are infrequently used.  There
have been, however, difficulties in determining what volumes are to be
included within the core collection.  It is usually necessary to establish
a committee or group of professional people who determine, usually by 
enumeration, those volumes that should be included in the core collection.
Often the results of such a determination merely reflect the opinions of
the individuals, and although valid in many cases as desirable reading, the
core collection that results may not be a reflection of user requirements.

Humphreys, K.
.W
  The traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries,
apart from those in Germany or affected by German practice, was imposed
by the weight given to the processing divisions.. The order department, which
in university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was not
considered to be of comparable importance with the major department --
the cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions would
be concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers or
official documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largely
autonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staff
were mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and in
answering queries of a very specialized nature on the library's collections,
especially on manuscripts or early printed books:  they rarely dealt with the
general bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-day
reference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to become
expert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any part
in the activities of another.. Divisions between the various 
kinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library's
organization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that this
is a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach.
Nonetheless this conservative view of the library's function tended to freeze
the administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject field
often undertook research in the subject outside the library and might
occasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of his
field, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connection
with his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer,
orientalist or linguist.
   The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a complete
re-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyond
the bounds of the old departments.

The Subject Specialist in National and University Libraries,
with Special Reference to Book Selection
.A
Danton, J.P.
.W
  Of the world's numerous kinds of libraries, the national and the university
may properly be characterized as having responsibilities for both general and
universal or nearly universal collecting in the realm of scholarship.  That is,
these two, and only these two, commonly collect over a very broad spectrum,
and in depth, material which makes possible the creation of new knowledge.
  Herein lies the paramount importance of these libraries to society if it be
granted, as it is here assumed, that almost no field of human endeavor can
advance without resort to the recorded past.  It is this twin aspect of the
activity of these scholarly libraries - collecting simultaneously in breadth
and in depth - which produces most of their major problems.  The concern of
this paper is with two of these problems which seem by far the most important
and difficult: the selection of materials and the utilization of subject
specialists.

Information Science in Librarianship
.A
Hayes, R.M.
.W
  These information systems create a real challenge for librarianship, since
on the surface it would seem that librarians can have a central role in their
development, their operation, and their management.  But to do so, librarians
must recognize the contribution they can make and be willing to accept the
challenges.

Weeding the Collection:  A Review of Research on Identifying Obsolete Stock
.A
Seymour, C.A.
.W
  Reverberations of the publishing explosion of recent years are reaching us
now.  Production of monographs and journals, research reports and government
documents has been increasing exponentially to the point that British
university librarians are beginning to feel the sense of constriction of space
which their American counterparts have been struggling with for a number
of years (judging by the amount of print devoted to the subject in American
library journals).  The force of this sense of constriction has been somewhat
mitigated in all but the copyright libraries by the general lack of funds
available for book purchasing, and by the increasing price of books.  However,
when space in the library does become filled, obviously something must
be done to create more space, because the flow of material is certainly not
going to cease.

PRECIS in a Multilingual Context
.A
Austin, D.
.W
    The present paper is offered as the first of a series of articles in which
PRECIS will be reviewed as a potential multi-lingual system, having in mind
the obvious need, notably in a European context, for standard and language-
independent methods of subject analysis and document description.  This
first paper outlines the origins of PRECIS, and considers its use in English-
Language indexing.  A second paper will deal in general terms with the
syntactical model which is used for producing PRECIS input strings and
index entries.  Later papers will then review the application of this model
to indexing in, firstly, the Germanic languages (e.g. German and Danish),
and, secondly, the Romance languages, illustrated by French.

Limits Growth
.A
Meadows, D.H.
.W
    In April 1968, a group of thirty individuals from ten
countries - scientists, educators, economists, humanists,
industrialists, and national and international civil servants -
gathered in the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome.  They met at
the instigation of Dr. Aurelio Peccei, an Italian industrial
manager, economist, and man of vision, to discuss a subject of 
staggering scope - the present and future predicament of man.
    A series of early meetings of The Club of Rome culminated
in the decision to initiate a remarkably ambitious undertaking
- the Project on the Predicament of Mankind.
    The intent of the project is to examine the complex of
problems troubling men of all nations: poverty in the midst
of plenty; degradation of the environment; loss of faith in
institutions; uncontrolled urban spread; insecurity of employment;
alienation of youth; rejection of traditional values; and inflation
and other monetary and economic disruptions.

  This manual is the culmination of a long search for a chemical

standard typewriter keyboard.  The necessity for such a notation
has been made almost inescapable by recent tremendous advances in
technology and the vast growth of chemical literature.

Linguistics and Information Science

Jones, Sparck, K.

  This study was commissioned by the Committee on Linguistics in
Documentation of the Federation Internationale de Documentation (FID).
It is concerned with the linguistic aspects of information science, and
in particular with the linguistic components of document analysis,
description, and retrieval.  We have attempted to relate linguistics
and information science by considering the theories and techniques
linguistics has to offer, and how far these have been, or could be, 
exploited by information scientists.  We have examined these questions
within the context of automated language processing and automated 
documentation.  The use of computers for linguistic operations presents
special challenges as well as interesting possibilities, and we have
chosen to approach the field from this particular point of view.

A List of Books for College Libraries
.A
Shaw, C.B.

  To permit a qualitative estimate of a college library's resources, the
Advisory Group on College Libraries of the Carnegie Corporation authorized
the compilation of a list of not less that 8,000 nor more than 15,000 titles
which might be regarded as a statement of the minimum or basic book collection
of a four-year liberal arts college.
  The procedure on which the Advisory Group decided included (1) the selection
of a librarian under whose direction the compilation should be made, (2) the
checking and improvement of the original lists drawn up by this compiler by such
a homogeneous group as the faculty of a single college, and (3) the submission
of these revised recommendations to an able group of widely scattered college
teachers for further revision.

A Little Commonwealth Family Life in Plymouth Colony

Demos, J.
.W
  The kind of study presented in this monograph has not as yet
won a wide following among working historians.  On the whole
their interest has remained with the larger units of social
action: the region, the class, the party, the ethnic or religious
group.  It has been left to the so-called behavioral sciences -
anthropology, sociology, psychology - to demonstrate the fundamental
importance of the smallest and most intimate of all group environments,
the family.

Little Science, Big Science
.A
De Solla Price, D.J.
.W
  Pegram lecturers are supposed to talk about science and
its place in society.  The ordinary way of doing this would
be either to talk popular science or to adopt one of the various
styles in humanistic discussion of the reactions between men
and science.  Previous lecturers in this series have given
accounts of the content of space science and made excursions
into the philosophy and the history of science.  Although
professionally my concern is with the history of science, I have
a certain prehistoric past as a physicist, and this has led
me to treat these lectures in what is, perhaps, an extraordinary
way.
  My goal is not discussion of the content of science or even
a humanistic analysis of its relations.  Rather, I want to clarify
these more usual approaches by treating separately all the
scientific analyses that may be made of science.  Why should
we not turn the tools of science on science itself?  Why not
measure and generalize, make hypotheses, and derive
conclusions?

Przeworski, A.
.W
  The ideas presented in this book developed during the course of our
participation in a comparative research project, the International Studies
of Values in Politics, which was a study of the relationship between
characteristics of local political leadership and the behavior of local
governments in India, Poland, the United States, and Yugoslavia.
  Among the first problems we confronted were those of measurement.
In the fall of 1965 the first pretest of value-scale items was under way.
The goal of the pretest was to develop valid and reliable scales of values
in four national samples.
  The second problem we had to face arose from the nees to obtain "comparable"
measures of community "activeness" in four countries.

Londoner and His Library
.A
Groombridge, B.
.W
  This report deals with a complementary theme: the public for which the
public library service is provided.  It does this in two ways - by giving
information about the nature of that public, as it is at present made up,
and by reporting what people say about public libraries, not only those
who are members, but also those who used to belong and those who never
have.  Its closest relatives in British writing on this subject are, therefore,
Mass Observation's now dated Reading in Tottenham (1947) and the
Society of Young Publishers' Survey Books in London, 1959.  It is more
comprehensive in scope and more detailed in its analysis that the Tottenham
survey, while it goes in some depth into issues that necessarily played 
only a small part in Books in London.

The Making of a Library
.A
Taylor, R.S.
.W
A book like this is a cumulation of experience, thought, error, and
hopefully, learning of many years.  It did not start, like a water faucet, at
precisely that moment in 1967 when the Office of Education so kindly
awarded a grant to Hampshire college for the development of the concept
of the extended and experimenting library, although the grant was certainly
the means for, and a spur to, it formalization.

Man's Aggression
.A
Montagu, M.F.A.
.W
  The purpose of this book is to inquire into the validity of the views
on human nature expressed in the widely read and influential books
of Robert Ardrey and Konrad Lorenz.  Ardrey's books are African
Genesis (Atheneum, 1961), and The Territorial Imperative (Atheneum,
1966).  Lorenz's book is On Aggression (Harcourt, Brace & World,
1966).  In these books the authors argue that man is by
instinct an aggressive creature, and it is this innate propensity to
violence that accounts for individual and group aggression in man.

Man-Machine Communication
.A
Meadow, C.T.
.W
  This book is an introduction to the elements, methods, and problems
of interactive systems and is tutorial in tone.  It is intended for both
users and designers of conversational systems: those who actually operate
them as well as those who design the overall systems in which they are
used.  I would expect, primarily, to draw my readers from among the
designers of information systems and such prospective users as teachers,
writers, librarians, lawyers, design engineers, and professional managers.
The book is a survey and is not intended as an exhaustive text.  The
reader wishing to pursue any topic in detail will have to seek further,
but I have provided references to help him do so.

The Management of Innovation
.A
Burns, T.
.W
  All the research reported in this book arose out of an attempt, some
years ago, to study an industrial concern as a 'community of people at
work', that is, in much the same terms one would use in a study of
conduct and relationships in a village, an urban neighborhood, or a
small primitive community.  This aim was never realized, because it
soon became evident that the social structure of the factory interlocked
with, and often mirrored, that of the small isolated town in which it
was situated.  The wider study which then appeared necessary was not
practicable and the enquiry petered out rather inconclusively, assuming
its present significance only in the context of later studies.

Towards a Behavioral Theory of Communication
.A
Ackoff, R.L.
.W
  This paper presents a conceptualization of information as related to the
decision problems of the recipient.  The orientation is toward a formal
definition of behavioral elements in an individual's "purposeful state":
specifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of each
objective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course of
action in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for each
course of action.
  The amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in
terms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action.
The amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the
amount of information in the purposeful state following the message, and the
amount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message.  The amount
of instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies
of the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined in
terms of the values of the objectives.	The amounts of instruction and 
motivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing the
amounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message.
  The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of
the amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount of
motivation in the state.  This concept can be generalized to express the value
of the state to some other individual.

Management Misinformation Systems
.A
Ackoff, R.L.
.W
  Five assumptions commonly made by designers of management information
systems are identified.  It is argued that these are not justified in many (if 
not most) cases and hence lead to major deficiencies in the resulting systems.
These assumptions are: (1) the critical deficiency under which most managers
operate is the lack of relevant information, (2) the manager needs the
information he wants, (3) if a manager has the information he needs his decision
making will improve, (4) better communication between managers improves
organizational performance, and (5) a manager does not have to understand
how his information system works, only how to use it.  To overcome these
assumptions and the deficiencies which result from them, a management
information system should be imbedded in a management control system.
A procedure for designing such a system is proposed and an example is given
of the type of control system which it produces.

Computational Analysis of Scoring Models for R and D Project Selection
.A
Moore, J.R.
Baker, N.R.
.W
  Several authors have proposed using scoring models for prescriptive analysis
of the R and D project selection decision problem.  This research indicates
that these models do not meet with important practical requirements.  For
example, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additive
index, in order to generate a wide range of project scores.  The additive
index is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index.
The most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitrary
fashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model
builders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on
resulting project scores.  Comparative analyses relating project rankings
produced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability
index and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of
the scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development
of the model.  Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions of
project data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals or
categories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implications
for final project scores and associated rankings.

A Scoring Methodology for Assessing the Suitability of Management Science
Models
.A
Souder, W.E.
.W
  In this study, five major criteria (realism, flexibility, capability, case
of use, and cost) for evaluating the suitability of management science models
for R & D project selection are established, through personal interviews with
R&D administrators and management scientists.  A suitability rating system,
based on these criteria, is used by the author to rate twenty-six management
science models for their suitability of use in R&D project selection decision
making.  Profitability index and scoring types of models were found to have
generally higher ease of use and lower cost performances than the other types.
The linear and nonlinear models had generally higher flexibility, while the
linear, nonlinear and zero-one models had generally higher realism than the
other model types.

The Managerial Grid
.A
Blake, R.R.
.W
  The Managerial Grid method of designating various
styles of leadership avoids these semantic traps.  Even more,
it shows how a leader can simultaneously maximize both 
the methods which are production-oriented and those which
are people-oriented.  Thus instead of putting a manager in
a dilemma of choosing one or the other alternative, it
illustrates that there are ways he can gain the benefits of
both.  It puts various methods of managing problems into
a framework where the leader can identify, study and
change his own behavior.  Thus he is in a position to understand
it better, to evaluate the results it produces, and to
encourage its use by others.

A Communications Format for Bibliographic Data

        The MARC (Machine-Readable-Cataloging) Pilot Project was an
experiment to test the feasibility of distributing Library of Congress
cataloging in machine-readable form to a variety of users.  This project
grew out of the conviction of many librarians that automation was becoming
necessary if libraries were to keep up with the rising tide of new
materials and the mounting demand for rapid information.  Although there
were other library procedures which stood to profit from mechanization,
it was felt that devising a method of recording bibliographical information
in machine-readable form was basic to the solution of other problems.

The MARC Pilot Project:
The Final Report
.A
Avram, H.D.
.W
  The MARC project has progressed from a
pilot to test the feasibility of a distribution
service of centrally produced machine-readable
cataloging data to a full-scale operational
system in the design stages in two short years.
The library community, both here and abroad, has
accepted MARC and recognizes its potential
for the future.  The single most significant
result of MARC has been the impetus to set
standards.  There is no doubt that eventually
standards would have been designed for
machine-readable bibliographic records, character
sets, and codes for place and language.  MARC
accelerated standardization and still more
important, the standards are being set and agreed

Mathematical Taxonomy
.A
Jardine, N.
.W
  In this book we give a mathematical account of some of the methods of data
simplification which are involved in or suggested by the practice of biological
taxonomy.  The computable methods derived are offered as potentially useful
tools for taxonomists, rather than as substitutes for their activities.
  Superficially similar problems of data simplification arise in pattern 
recognition and in the various sciences which make substantial use of
classificatory systems:  biological taxonomy, ecology, psychology, linguistics,
archaeology, sociology, etc.  But more detailed examination shows that the
kinds of classification used and the kinds of data on which they are based
differ widely from science to science.  Whilst we recognize that some of the
methods described here, particularly in Part II of the book, are more
widely applicable, we have deliberately limited discussion to biological
taxonomy.  The emphasis throughout is on the clarification of the mathematical
properties of methods of automatic classification and of the conditions under
which their application is valid, so that anyone who wishes to apply the
methods in other fields shall be aware of their limitations, and of the lines
along which they may profitably be developed and modified.

The Mathematical Theory of Communication
.A
Shannon, C.E.
.W
  The word communication will be used here in a very broad sense
to include all of the procedures by which one mind may affect
another.  This, of course, involves not only written and oral
speech, but also music, the pictorial arts, the theatre, the ballet,
and in fact all human behavior.  In some connections it may be
desirable to use a still broader definition of communication,
namely, one which would include the procedures by means of
which one mechanism (say automatic equipment to track an
airplane and to compute its probably future positions) affects
another mechanism (say a guided missile chasing this airplane).
  The language of this memorandum will often appear to refer to
the special, but still very broad and important, field of the 
communication of speech; but practically everything said applies
equally as well to music of any sort, and to still or moving
pictures, as in television.

Meaning and the Structure of Language
.A
Chafe, W.L.
.W
  The work to which this chapter forms a preface arises out of a deep
and prolonged dissatisfaction which the author has felt with both
past and present theories of the structure of language.  This
dissatisfaction may be understood more readily, and the suggestions
which make up the body of this work may appear in clearer perspective,
if I begin with a few remarks of an autobiographical nature.
The intrinsic importance of these remarks is minimal, but they may
provide a useful background for what follows.

Measurement of Meaning
.A
Osgood, C.E.
.W
  The scientific study of language has been developing with particular
rapidity during the past decade or so.  One thinks immediately of
the basic work of Zipf and Skinner, of the developments in information
theory, in concept formation, in second language learning, in
work association research, and generally of the increasing integration
of the psychological and linguistic approaches as reflected in the
activities of the Social Science Research Council Committee on
Linguistics and Psychology.  Almost every new issue of a social
science journal brings additional evidence of this heightened activity.
A significant aspect of much of this development has been the 
devising and application of new quantitative measurement techniques.
During the past six or seven years, a group of us at the
University of Illinois has been concentrating on the development
of an objective measure of meaning, and this book is largely a
progress report of that research.

Measurement of Satisfaction in Work and Retirement
.A
Smith, P.C.
.W
    The focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle: A Strategy
for the Study of Attitudes.  This strategy is developed by devoting
considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and,
particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of
satisfaction.  In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of
requirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two
elements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any
previous report in the area of job satisfaction.
    Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both
academicians and practitioners.  For the former, it should serve as a
powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature
and correlates of satisfaction.  For too many years we in this area have
been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring
devices.  This has led to a plethora of studies each using a different
scale or measuring instrument.  As a consequence, this has opened the
door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the
jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction.  At the very least, the
present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed
measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across
studies.  If so, this may well bring some meaningful order to the present 
rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction.

Measuring the Quality of Library Service:  A Handbook
.A
Beeler, M.G.
.W
	There is probably no measurement task which public
servants face which is more difficult than that of measuring
the quality of service.  It is as difficult to measure the
quality of hospital service, or of schools, or of social
welfare programs, as it is to determine the quality of library
service.  It is equally as difficult to decide what actions to
take in order to improve service.
        Legislators, urban and regional planners, consultants,
boards of trustees, accrediting teams, librarians, and a
host of other decision makers must act on the basis of some
conclusions about the quality of service offered by library
systems.  This handbook is intended for these groups, and
especially for practicing librarians.  The pervasiveness of
the problem across all public service institutions, however,
leads us to hope that the handbook will be of interest to
other groups.

Medical Innovation: a diffusion study
.A
Coleman, J.S.
.W
  The research reported here constitutes a case study in the acceptance
of an innovation.  The innovation is a medical one, a drug which
physicians use in everyday practice; the setting is in the Midwestern
United States in the 1950's.  This study gives a glimpse of one small
part of the great changes that have recently occurred within medicine
and thus is of specific interest to the medical profession and its
allied institutions.
  But more generally, the question of the spread of an innovation
is of interest to all students of society.  Particularly in an age of
change, and in our complex and massive society, an understanding
of the way in which an innovation can spread - for better or worse!
- constitutes important knowledge of man.  It is to aid in this
understanding, as well as to describe the case at hand, that this report
is written.

MEDLARS
1963-1967
.A
Austin, C.J.
.W
  The purpose of this document is to present
a final description of the system as it has
evolved through a period of four years of
operation.  This will add the final chapter to
the present MEDLARS story at a time when
the Library is on the threshold of developing
an entirely new system, utilizing the latest
techniques of documentation and information
science coupled with modern, "third-
generation" computer equipment.
  The reader interested in a complete chronicle
of the Library's experience with MEDLARS is
advised to combine the reading of this report
with a re-reading of the original MEDLARS
story.  Thus he will be able to develop a
complete picture that answers the questions:
(1) What did the Library set out to do?
(2) What was actually accomplished? and
(3) What changes were made in the original
system design and why?

Melcher on Acquisition
.A
Melcher, D.
.W
    This book originally set out to be a kind of reporting-in-depth of
the American Library Association Pre-Conference on Acquisitions
held in Atlantic City in the summer of 1969 - a report embracing not
only the essential content of the formal speeches, but also the floor
discussions and after-hours bull sessions.
    Meanwhile, however, a closely similar treatment of the problem of
how to buy library materials, long in process, suddenly shaped up and
was published by ALA in November 1969.  This was Purchasing Library
Materials in Public and School Libraries by Evelyn Hensel and Peter D.
Veilette.
    A treatment of the acquisition process in college and university
libraries was also taking shape at this time and became the January
1970 issue of Library Trends.  The acquisition problems of research
libraries were likewise getting detailed examination in the two annual
International Seminars on Approval and Gathering Plans in Large and
Medium Size Academic Libraries, sponsored by Western Michigan University
in the fall of 1968 and the fall of 1969.

Methods of Information Handling
.A
Bourne, C.P.
.W
  This book is meant to be an aid and reference work
for those people who are interested in the design of
information systems.  Such information systems are
typified by the traditional libraries, but the same
problems of information processing, storage, and
retrieval are present in many government and
industrial organizations in many places besides the
library.  This book provides an illustration of the
tools, equipment, and methodology that might be
applied to those problems.

Relevance Predictability in Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Kent, A.
Belzer, J.
Kurfeerst, M.
Dym, E.D.
Shirey, d.L.
Bose, A.
.W
  An experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicators
regarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuli
used to represent documents in information retrieval systems.  In effect,
since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon
the examination of one "level of processing" of the document (e.g., the
citation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the properties
of what constitutes "relevance".  However, prior to such an analysis, an
even more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portions
of a document should be examined.
  An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs),
functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predict 
the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents
by motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlled
experimental conditions.  The hypothesis that there might be other intermediate
response products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph,
last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would be
representative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation and
abstract) was tested systematically.  The results showed that:
    1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatment
       groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match
       the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document;
    2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted
       relevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs;
    3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and
    4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not
       substantive.
  Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previous
work with unmotivated subjects.

The Use of Biomedical Periodical Literature at the National Lending
Library for Science and Technology
.A
Wood, D.N.
Bower, C.A.
.W
  The paper reports the results of a two week questionnaire survey of the use
of biomedical periodical literature carried out at the UK National Lending 
Library in February 1969.  The survey was designated to discover the subject,
date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature, the most
frequently requested journals, and the most popular sources of references
to biomedical publications.
  The loans were spread over 1,084 titles, although 9 per cent of the issues
involved only 2 per cent of the titles.  The literature in most demand was
less than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requests
were for literature lss than 3 1/2 years old.  The half-life for the biological
literature was somewhat longer at 5 3/4 years.  The majority of issues (87.8
per cent) involved English language periodicals.
  Overall, the principal sources of references to the requested literature
were citation lists in other periodical articles.  Regarding the more recent
literature, however, abstracting and indexing journals were the primary
sources of information.  For medical references Index Medicus was the most
used indexing publication, and for biological references Current Contents.

Metropolitan Public Library
.A
Bundy, M.L.
.W
  Public libraries in the 1960's which are active and alert and interested
in meeting the interests of their various publics face problems far
different from those of even a decade ago.  The Maryland metropolitan area
is an example of the many changes taking place in metropolitan areas
which require corresponding change in the type and form and arrangements for
library service and even demand looking into the very nature of library
service itself.

  Part I dealt with the selection of a microtext manager and
with procedural consideration in the acquisition process.
Part II continues the discussion about acquisitions, including
considerations of format, variation, and reliability of
publisher-supplied project information.  The Library's
search for an adequate system of bibliographic control is
examined.  Cataloging methods, classification schemes, and
hardcopy guides and indexes are discussed as components
of bibliographic control.

User Resistance to Microforms in the Research Library
.A
Salmon, S.R.
.W
  Microforms enjoy only limited acceptance in research libraries, largely
because of user resistance.  A growing number of published studies indicate
that improper production, inadequate bibliographic access, lack of 
standardization, defects in equipment design, maintenance problems,
poor environments for microform usage, and certain inherent characteristics
of the microforms themselves all combine to make their use inconvenient.
Solutions to most of these problems have existed for some time, but the
microform industry has been slow to correct them.  Some positive developments
have occurred in the last two years, but the major problems remain.

Microforms in Libraries
.A
Diaz, A.T.
.W
  Why do libraries use microforms?  According to a 1974 survey by a
micropublisher, saving space was the reason given by most respondents.
Holmes, on the other hand, found, "to acquire materials not otherwise
available," as the major reason.  Others include: (1) Instead of binding
serials (journals are retained unbound for two to three years after
publication, the period of heaviest use, and are then discarded and
replaced by microform versions; (2) To preserve deteriorating materials;
(3) Easing access to bulky materials such as newspapers; (4) To provide
working copies of materials too delicate for continued use such as rare
books; (5) to save money - in most cases the cost of an out-of-print set or
serial backfile will be substantially less in microform than the cost of a
full-size reprint or the cost of the original on the used book market;
(6) Ease of acquisition - i.e., acquiring materials which would otherwise
be difficult to acquire; (7) Mutilations reduced.

Milestones in Cataloging
.A
Lehnus, d.J.
.W
    In the case of the present study, Dr.Lehnus was interested in applying
a method - in a non-standard way for that method - to a type of literature that
had not been addressed so far.  He proposed to begin with a single monograph
on the subject "cataloging," apply the method of citation analysis to the
references of that work, and determine whether a core literature on
cataloging could be discovered in this way.  There are innumerable examples
of core literatures in scientific fields obtained from journal articles or
through the Science citation index, but research via the monograph in non-
scientific subjects has been minimal.

Patterns of Evaluation in Science:
Institutionalization, Structure and
Functions of the Referee System
.A
Zuckerman, H.
Merton, R.K.
.W
  The referee system in science involves the systematic use of judges to
assess the acceptability of manuscripts submitted for publication.  The
referee is thus an example of status-judges who are charged with evaluating
the quality of role-performance in a social system.  They are found in
every institutional sphere.  Other kinds of status-judges include teachers
assessing the quality of work by students (and, as a recent institutional
change, students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers),
critics in the arts, supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in
sports.  Status-judges are integral to any system of social control through
their evaluation of role-performance and their allocation of rewards for
that performance.  They influence the motivation to maintain or to raise
standards of performance.

The Development of a Scientific Specialty:
The Phage Group and the Origins of Molecular Biology
.A
Mullins, N.C.
.W
  This paper analyses the formation of a new discipline, molecular biology,
from the development of phage work.  It argues that such social variables
as the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities or
disciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explain
phage work's development into the specialty of molecular biology.  Even
though persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decided
to enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even though
some recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficient
to account for the development of the specialty, particularly given the
competitiveness of modern conditions.  In the emergence of molecular
biology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position,
adduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergence
of experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and
philosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities which
occur in scientific development.

Modern Manuscripts  A Practical Manual for Their Management, Care and Use

Duckett, K.W.
.W
                The title of this book is intended to indicate
that its scope is limited to manuscripts of the seventeenth century
to the present.  Examples and techniques are drawn from institutions
in the United States with occasional references to practices in Great
Britain and Canada.  The book is directed toward the novice curator
of manuscripts, and, again, as the title indicates, it is intended to 
serve as a practical guide, not as an exposition of theory.

Modern Organizations
.A
Etzione, A.
.W
                The plan of this book follows our definition of organizations
as social units that pursue specific goals which they are structured to
serve, obviously under some social circumstances.  Therefore the book has
three foci:  organizational goals; organizational structure; and organizations
and their social environment.  Considerably more space is devoted to
organizational structure than to the other topics, for two reasons:  First,
more research has been conducted and more writings are available on
organizational structure than on organizational goals (Chapter 2) and 
environment.  Second, the major schools of organizational analysis have fixed
their interests on structural aspects of the organization, and thus, we may
best evaluate these different approaches in the context of organizational
structure.

A Modern Outline of Library Classification
.A
Mills, J.
.W
        This outline is based mainly on lectures given at the North-Western
Polytechnic to students studying for the Library Association's Registration
Examination in Classification and Cataloguing.
        It is hoped that it will help to meet the need, increasingly felt in 
recent years by students and teachers of the subject, for a reasonably simple
textbook on Library Classification which takes account of the considerable 
developments which have occurred in the subject in the past 25 years.  As is 
well known, a great deal of this has been due to Dr. Ranganathan, and also,
in more recent years, to Mr. B. C. Vickery.  As a result of these developments,
a coherent theory of library classification has been established in each
of its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and in
the alphabetical indexing of systematic orders.  It is now possible to
construct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions
(of relating subjects helpfully, and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly)
is considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used.  Moreover, they
are easier to construct.

Modern Systems Research for the Behavioral Scientist. A Sourcebook
.A
Buckley, W.
.W
  Although it is hoped that this sourcebook will
be of interest to those of any discipline concerned
with new developments in science of the last
quarter century, it is addressed principally to the
student of human behavior as that study is
approached from the social side.  This is so partly
because that is the editor's main competence and
interest, but primarily because the study of human
behavior is the general area of science that has
least responded to the exciting challenge of the
modern systems outlook.  Yet it is precisely this
general area that stands to gain the most from
insights into the workings of the more complex
types of systems.

Motivation and Personality

Maslow, A.H.

  This book was started during the years 1935-1936 and was
intended to be a systematic psychology of the older type.  My
effort was to synthesize the holistic, the dynamic and the cultural
emphases which, each one, excited so many young psychologists
of the time.  I felt that they were intrinsically related to each
other, and that they were subaspects of a single, larger, encompassing
whole.  I felt also that they would make more meaningful my
previous studies at the University of Wisconsin in comparative
and experimental psychology, and in biology and neurophysiology.
Furthermore, I felt that they would enable me to serve better
my humanistic aims.

The Motivation to Work
.A
Herzberg, F.
.W
  This book reports the findings from a study of job motivation
based on a fresh approach to this problem.  It is an important
study, since the analyses and interpretations of the authors
suggest that a breakthrough may well have been made to provide
new insights into the nature and method of operation of job
attitudes.
  The senior authors were well prepared for their task, having
recently completed a comprehensive review and analysis of the
research in this field, reported in Job Attitudes: Review of
Research and Opinion.  This review of several thousand articles
and books regarding the factors relating to job attitudes and the
effect of job attitudes on work performance indicated much
disagreement and confusion in the field.  It appeared that one of
the major contributors to this apparent diversity of results was
the unstable nature of the subjective data on which studies in
this field have been typically based.

GREMAS - A System for Classification and Documentation in Organic Chemistry

Fugmann, R.

Vanpel, W.
.W
  The authors of this essay were faced with the task of organizing
a documentation office in which a large number of publications and
patents in chemistry would have to be processed.  This large collection
would be made available to a large group of elements without restrictions.
To permit a large frequency of use, and to maintain this also with increases
in file sizes, it becomes necessary to limit especially that faction of the
task which consists in the retrieval activities paper.
  Savings in the retrieval activity are possible only at the expense of
greater effort in indexing and by heavier use of technical aids.  We have taken
the second path by consciously applying the principles	to a highly detailed
faceted classification.

Automatic Construction of Thesauri and of Concept Systems
for Dictionaries and Subject Lists
.A
Lang, F.H.
.W
  After a synopsis of the relations existing between descriptors and their 
concepts, the EPD-program called "GENTHES" is described.  The program supports
the construction of a thesaurus and its use.  The relational system corresponds
to ISO/DIS 2788 (UNESCO) and DIN 1463.  It differentiates, however, in addition
generically related and contiguous terms pertaining to a part-whole system.
Characteristics that determine narrower terms against their broader terms are
introduced as new relation.  Many types of associations are made available for
experimenting.  The programmed generation of dependent relations reduces the
amount of work to one third although ensuring total avoidance of formal errors
and logical contradictions, even in applying permitted polyhierarchy.  The
program is available in batch mode or in an interactive timesharing version
(Remote GENTHES).  The program functions are input, logical and formal input
checking, generation of relations, display, delete, print on line printer and
storage on disk.  GENTHES is running in Vienna on a System IBM/370.

  Backed up by numerical data  derived from an ASLIB analysis of the planned
world-wide system of UNISIST, the author critically investigates the claimed
university of the U.D.C.  According to it, the so-called "Universal Decimal
Classification" proves to be fragmentary.  Terminological aspects are not
provided for, hierarchical order often is fictitious, and the representation
of special fields is inadequate.  For the purpose of reforming the Decimal
Classification, a reconstruction scheme is suggested, consisting of free
facets, with the aid of which special classifications can be compiled,
according to the modular principle.

Possibilities for Revisions of the DK (Decimal Classification)
.A
Dahlberg, I.
.W
  For a number of reasons mentioned it is proposed to reorganize in a new
edition the existing UDC completely, to reallocate the subject fields of
the UDC main classes according to present day views, state of knowledge and
priorities, and to subdivide these main classes only by subfields of subject
fields.  The specific facets of each field should be represented by a uniform
array of special auxiliaries attached to the fields through the technique
of interrupted subdivision.  These should express the following categories:
(1) Theory, (2) Objects, (3) Processes, (4) Attributes, (6) Order, organization,
(7) Relation, (8) Determination, (9) Evaluation. ((5) is left free for the 
moment).  Proposals for further simplification of the scheme are outlined
regarding the general categories, the symbols used and the rules for 
syntagmatic organization taking into account the implications of computer
technology.  Possible changes in the layout and editions of a new UDC are
discussed.

Comments about Terminology in Documentation.
II:  communication and Information 
.A
Wersig, V.G.
Meyer-Uhlenried, K.
.W
  Developing from the definitions of the concept language a terminological
represented model of the communication process can be deduced that shows
the transfer of meaning between communicator and recipient through
communication channels and mediators.  The distinguished communication
structures are communication sequences, chains, nets and systems.  With an
universal definition of data as fixed representations of facts by means of
signs the various meanings of the term "information" are terminological to
differentiate as "information," "information process" and "informations."
The theory of signs makes the differentiation of syntactical, semantical,
sigmatical and pragmatical information possible.  Adequate to communication
process and system we can determine informing process and information system.

Computerized Information Retrieval Services
(Automatisierte Information Retrieval Dienste)
.A
Standera, O.
.W
  Following an outline of the current trend in information storage, retrieval,
and dissemination, this paper provides a description of some of the information
services offered at the University of Calgary.  The services include processing
of data-bases supplied on magnetic tapes.  The system is briefly characterized
as featuring natural text processing.  Selective dissemination of information
is directed to users periodically in response to their profiles, and 
retrospective searches are performed on request, both in the batch mode.
Feedback from users and system performance are also briefly reviewed.

National Aspects of Creating and Using MARC/RECON Records
.A
Rather, J.C.
.W
  Concurrently with the RECON Pilot Project, the RECON working Task Force 
undertook to consider certain basic questions of retrospect conversation
that are of national scope.
  First, is it feasible to define a level or subset of the MARC format that 
would allow a library using the lower level to be part of a future national
network?
  Second, is it possible to use machine-readable records from a variety of 
sources in a national bibliographic store as a way to reduce the conversion
effort on the national level?
  Third, what are the problems of producing a National Union Catalog from 
machine-readable records?
  As these studies and the pilot project progressed, it also became apparent 
that there were many practical difficulties in carrying out a large-scale 
conversion project.  Therefore, it seemed essential to investigate alternative 
strategies for RECON that might yield broad benefits in a reasonable short 
time span.

National Document-Handling Systems for Science and Technology
.A
Carter, L.F.
.W
  This book has grown out of a study undertaken for the Committee on Scientific 
and Technical Information (COSATI) Task Group on National Systems(s) for 
Scientific and Technical Information in support of their examination of national
document and information systems.  The emphasis of the study as stated by 
COSATI is as follows:
    1. Initial and primary priority will be placed on national systems 
relating to scientific and technical documents, their handling and the
management of such documents.  Specific matters to be reported on will include, 
the current organizational and functional situation in the United States; the 
extent to which known  deficiencies are causing a reduction in the  potential 
for technical effectiveness in the United States scientific and technical 
community; the alternatives which are available and economically feasible for 
correction of these deficiencies; and one or more action plans which can be
followed by governmental (especially including Congress) and non-governmental 
units.
    2. Secondary attention will be given to development of programs which can 
be undertaken with Government support for identifying,  analyzing, and giving 
a structure to the total flow of scientific and technical information in the 
United States."

Generalization of Epidemic Theory An Application to the Transmission of Ideas
.A
Goffman, W.
Newill, V.A.
.W
  One of the most fundamental problems in the field of information retrieval 
is that of determining the circumstances under which it might be necessary to
introduce an information retrieval system as an aid to a given population of 
scientists.  It is proposed that this problem be examined in terms of the 
transmission and development of ideas within a population.  Specifically, the 
transmission of ideas within a population will be treated as if it were the
transmission of an infectious disease, that is, in terms of an epidemic process.
An attempt will be made to indicate the role of information retrieval in the
development of such a process.

Mathematical Approach to the Spread of Scientific Ideas - The History of 
Mast Cell Research
.A
Goffman, W.
.W
  One of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure nature 
of its own growth.  Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at 
one time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their 
particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of
its future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance to 
scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their
own right.
  Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread 
within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can 
therefore be investigated as an epidemic process.  Consequently, a new set of 
mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of 
scientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to 
establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area 
of scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines
of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the 
given area.
  The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it
to the development of knowledge about mast cells.  In his recent comprehensive 
survey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a "full bibliography" 
in which "every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with."  This bibliography 
constitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread of 
scientific ideas, since it provides us with  all the contributions to the 
subject area, from Ehrlich's discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963.

   An evaluation of the Chemical Society's Chemical Titles information
retrieval service compared with a parallel manual search of the literature
has shown that, at least in certain disciplines, more than 90 per cent of the

Library Optimum
.A
Sandison, A.
.W
Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical
framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold.  He is
careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, 
in case the value of the aging factor a or the
contents of the Bradford set change from year to year.  There is as yet very 
little experimental evidence on the consistency
of either.  Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor 
is reasonably constant.  But the position of
the Bradfod set is less satisfactory.  The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M.
Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in 
the Journal of Ecology three or more times in
1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in 
the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in
both.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, 
only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and
twelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rank 
correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant.
  There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data
analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid
parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is no
mention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from the 
earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which 
analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in 
terms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger have
discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations 
to that article.  Their work implies a more complex
relation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity of
citations for forecasting library consultations
remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not
necessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is often 
intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again,
each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of 
which he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there any
inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between 
the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers.

Effectiveness of Combining Title Words and Index
Terms in Machine Retrieval Searches
.A
Fisher, H.L.
.W
  Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science
Abstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we
used the generalized file-management system, Master Control,
which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode.
The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique
vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with
all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For
example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one
entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus
the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For
example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one
entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus
the record numbers in which each word was found.  (In Master
Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on
either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma,
colon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode the
data element is compared with the profile word, character by
character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming
process for large data bases.
  We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large
amount of data to be searched.  Individual tables were
constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and
titles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlled
by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA.
  We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions had
to be of real interest to laboratory personnel.  Some of the
questions had actually been submitted by other members of the
staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI
basis.  The others were especially constructed by the authors
for this experiment.  Second, citations obtained were to be
considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to
the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered
"false drops," regardless of the number of words matched
between the profile and the citation.

Method for Relating the Structure and  Properties of Chemical Compounds
.A
Adamson, G.W.
.W
  The structure diagrams of chemical compounds are widely
used in the communication of chemistry.  They are also used
in chemical information systems, mainly as keys for the
retrieval of associated information.  However some chemical
information systems hold property data as well as structure
diagrams in machine-readable forms.  If structure-property
relationships could be investigated easily within chemical
information systems, then the usefulness of the systems would
be considerably increased.  Described below are some results
which have been obtained during investigation of structure-
property relationships using a combination of regression 
analysis and some techniques of chemical structure handling used
in information systems.

Concerning the Criterion for Evaluation of Current Secondary Information
.A
Zilbermints, L.V.
.W
   The findings are described of a study aimed at determining the prospects and
methods for improving the system of current bibliographic information..  The
analysis has shown that the existing criteria for evaluation of special
bibliographies (scope, coverage, arrangement, speed of announcement, etc.) are
inadequate for an unbiased characterization of their exhaustivity and subject
contents..  This hampers a correct choice of the sources of secondary 
information and leads to duplication, parallelisms and loss of information..
Judgements of the leading Soviet and foreign bibliographers relating to the
problems under consideration are reviewed, which are all essentially in favor 
of a reconstruction of the publishing processes, issuing of scientific 
publications on a world scale, and algorithmization of the information
processes..  It is suggested that the first objective of research should be
a method of comparative evaluation of periodicals..

On Factors Influencing the Attitude of Scientists and Engineers towards
Scientific Information
.A
Shekhurin, D.
.W
   The most important objective factors are considered influencing the limits
and the depth of information needs of researchers and designers, i.e. the 
growth of information flow, the level of specialization, the qualification
standard, the official position, the development rates of scientific or
technical discipline in question the teamwork on scientific or engineering
projects, the language barrier, the specifics of narrowly specialized
terminology, as well as a number of subjective (psychological) factors
like inclination to creative work, type of memory, the time available, methods
of sources handling..
   The investigations into, and account of, these factors are indispensable for
raising the efficiency both of information systems performance and the
activities of scientific and engineering communities served..
   Some statistical data are cited obtained during investigations into
information demand patterns for various personnel groups at research and
development institutions..

On Informal Processes of Science Communications
.A
Markusova, V.A.
.W
   The paper makes a discussion of major theoretical and experimental studies
of the role of informal processes of communication in science..  The author
holds that the system of scientific communications is based on formal processes
(founded on scientific and technical literature, including the primary and
secondary sources), whereas the informal processes (in which scientists play
the leading part and which have no institutionalized and permanent interactive
mechanisms) are also very important, but auxiliary..  The specific features
of the informal processes and their interaction with the formal processes are
analyzed in detail.  Recommendations towards efficient use of the positive
aspects of informal communications for raising the overall effectiveness of
scientific communication system are offered..

Informational Reviews in the Age of Information Crisis
.A
Altsculer, M.S.
.W
  A critical analysis is given of existing classification
schemes for reviews.  The author proposes to distinguish
between two main review types: orienting and informative
ones.  The importance is stressed of informative
(analytical and abstracting) reviews, which contain
new information under the conditions of information
crisis being interpreted as overproduction of documents
rather than new knowledge.

   Postulating an interrelation between semantic and pragmatic properties of 
scientific information, the author formulates the information value function
as depending on three arguments:  subject, information, and purpose; thus, this 
value is a composite of subjective and objective factors..  Possible 
classifications scientific information values are discussed.. A methodological
analysis of three approaches to the mathematical notion of information value is
given and, by analogy, some propositions concerning measurement of scientific
information value are expressed..

Methods for Thesaurus Generation
.A
Chernyi, A. I.
.W
   The author gives a general definition of the IR thesaurus and outlines its 
inner structure.. He describes a procedure of accumulating the body of keywords 
which is required to compile the vocabulary of descriptors.. An attempt is made
to determine how the rate of keyword accumulation depends on the number of 
abstracts' titles processed and in what way the volume of descriptor vocabulary
is related to the number of documents indexed.. General rules are given for 
lexicographic processing of the keywords accumulated and for compiling of the
descriptor vocabulary.. The algorithm has been constructed which is designed 
to generate the article of each descriptor in the thesaurus.. To construct this
algorithm the author analyzed the results of word-association tests and 
selected 5 most important types of paradigmatic relations.. He formulates the 
basic rules for translation of the texts describing the main subject content of
the documents and of the users' requests from a natural language into the IR
language of descriptors.. (The block diagram of algorithm for translation of
these texts is also given..) In conclusion the author describes general
principles of lexicographic editing of the above mentioned texts..

A Grammatical Elements in a Descriptor Language for an 
Information Retrieval System
.A
Ivanova, N. I.
Margaritov, V. B.
.W
   The results are described of research and development activities of the 
Mechanized Information Retrieval Laboratory of the NIITEKHIM.. Research 
Institute aimed towards creating a descriptor language for an information
retrieval system in the field of chemistry and chemical engineering.. The
objectives of an optimum reduction of retrieval noise and maximum recall have 
required the introduction of grammatical and transformational devices into the
language.. The former condition is provided for by a matrix notation of 
document search patterns and requests, while the latter condition is met with
the help of the transformational devices of the language..
   Examples of search requests and patterns are considered, which illustrate
the "resolution" of the grammatical and transformational devices being 
developed.. These are said largely to eliminate subjectiveness in assigning
relational factors in search patterns and requests..
   The relevancy criterion is formulated.. A retrieval algorithm based on this
criterion has been compiled..
   Experimental searches were conducted on a Minsk-22 computer.. The results 
were analyzed to evaluate the grammatical and transformational devices and to
verify indexing principles devised for the automated retrieval system under
development..
   Factors of "silence" are discussed, as well as the contribution of the 
grammatical and transformational devices to reducing noise and enhancing 
recall..

   A study has been carried out dealing with the development of science in
terms of sets of scientific and technical data.. It is assumed that the 
characteristics of a rank distribution provide unbiased data to reflect the
process of differentiation of sciences..
   Rank distribution over the sets of scientific and technical information are
characterized by the formation of a "kernel" of the distribution and of the
"problematic" nature as a phenomenon..
   A mathematical model is considered to be used for computing the values of
the "kernelness" and "problematicity" of a rank distribution..

Some Aspects of Developing and Studying a Descriptor Information Language
for General Technology
.A
Shemakin, Yu. I.
.W
   The methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrieval
language for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnical
document collection are described.. The descriptor dictionary includes general
and special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to
higher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a
lexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the
dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords..
   The indexing procedure includes:  analysis of document content and its
characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the
search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described
which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that
constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed 
content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval 
language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of
the document..
   Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using
mathematical-statistic methods are given..
   Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and
70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been 
corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to
2,500 search patterns using 42 requests..  Among the factors of losses there
are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single
abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future
charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor
language.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical
sensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be   
based on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods for
document and request indexing..

   The structure of the information field of a social system is examined,
analyzing the processes of formation of scientific concepts.. The functional  
structure of the information field is shown to reflect that of human brain..
It is established that the effect of the "wash-off" of noise out of the
information field with the course of time leads to concentration of the real,
socially valid free information in publications covering finite time spans..
The interrelations within the service/user system are shown to be essentially
different for scientific vs industrial information supplies..

Aspect Abstracting:  A New Technique
.A
Solovyev, V. I.  
.W
   The new technique has been developed on the basis of an analysis of the
present methodological requirements laid to abstracting and a study of textual
records as modelling the real world and reflecting the logic of research..
Aspects of meaning have been adopted as the invariant unit characteristics
of a document's purport.. Semantic adequacy and semantic equivalence are 
proposed as criteria to evaluate abstracting precision and exhaustivity..
The aspect-based approach could be likewise applied to indexing of documents
and information requests.. If introduced into the practices of information
analysis, this technique is expected to raise the standard of abstracts and 
the efficiency of document-oriented retrieval..

the influence of the definition adopted on the structure of a data retrieval
system.. A proposition is advanced that a factographic JRS is a rudimentary but
indispensable form on the way to a logical information system.. The latter type
of system by a capability for automatic analysis of input data and synthesis of
new information.. The problem of the information retrieval language for data
retrieval system is discussed, as is its machine organization, intricately

On the Symbolic Nature of Classifications
.A
Panova, N. S.
Shreider, Yu. A.

   The nature of an arbitrary classification is considered from the viewpoint
of its sign function.. The structure of the taxons described by a given 
classification is treated as the referent (the denotate).. The formation of
taxons is shown to be connected with the preliminary arrangement of the subject
area into a classification field..
   The classification concept is connected with the structure and nature of
the classification characteristics.. A typology of classifications is 
introduced, distinguishing them by intensionality, or capacity for expression
of the concept independent of the subject area.. Differences are pointed out
that exist between the classificatory and thematic relationships and the 
correlations between these two groups of relationships are analyzed..

Algebra of Classification
.A
Shreider, Yu. A.
.W
   Two alternative concepts of isomorphism of classification are examined..
It is shown that with the accuracy of up to isomorphism, the structure of a
classification is characterized by a certain semigroup.. For an important type 
of classifications, the algebraic structure of these semigroups is completely
characterized by the relation of order on the set of generants.. The case of
"perfect order" on the generants corresponds to hierarchical (tree) 
classifications.. The case of "incomparability" of the generants corresponds to
facet classifications.. All the other cases are "intermediate" between these
two types of classification..

Technology, National Bureau of Standards.  Consideration is first
given to indexes compiled by or with the aid of machines,
including citation indexes.  Automatic derivative indexing is
exemplified by key-word-in-context (KWIC) and other word-
in-context techniques.  Advantages, disadvantages, and
possibilities for modification and improvement are discussed.
Experiments in automatic assignment indexing are summarized.
Related research efforts in such areas as automatic classification
and categorization, computer use of thesauri, statistical
association techniques, and linguistic data processing are
described.  A major question is that of evaluation, particularly
in view of evidence of human inter-indexer inconsistency.  It
is concluded that indexes based on words extracted from text
are practical for many purposes today, and that automatic
assignment indexing and classification experiments show promise
for future progress.

Neighborhood Information Centers
A Study and Some Proposals
.A
Kahn, A.J.
.W
  Our point of departure is a study of the feasibility and desirability
of adapting the British Citizens' Advice Bureau (CAB) plan to the
United States, carried out with the financial support and cooperation
of the Ford Foundation.
  We conclude that the British CAB pattern, while creative, richly
implicative and a major source of valuable guidance, if merely duplicated
would not make the optimum contribution to the current American scene.
  We find overwhelming evidence that new information, advice, referral
provision are necessary.  Localities need and want Neighborhood Information
Centers (NIC's).
  We find promising beginnings and a number of attractive possibilities
emerging out of the somewhat different efforts by a number of federal
agencies, local government and local voluntary groups.  However, no one
of these provides auspices for all the needed functions in accord with
qualities which we find to be essential.

Networks for Research and Education
.A
Greenberger, M.
.W
  Responding to the heightened interest in the possibilities of networks,
and reflecting its own continuing interest in improving the use of new
technologies in research and education, the National Science Foundation
in 1972 announced the mounting of "an expanded research program . . .
to explore . . . the resource-sharing potential of a national network in
support of research and education."  The NSF was well aware of the obstacles
and uncertainties, and it knew that although shareable resources and
pockets of relevant information and experience existed, many of the people
who should be involved in planning were not currently informed or discussing
the possibilities with one another.

A Core Medical Library for Practitioners in Community Hospitals
.A
Stearns, N.S.
Ratcliff, W.W.
.W
  In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluate
and encourage continuing education programs in
community hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute
(PMI) has determined that there is need for
guidance in the area of medical-library development.
Reports from PMI physician consultants who visited
more than 40 community hospitals indicate that
medical-library facilities are generally poor and 
infrequently used by physicians.  The basic
weaknesses of these libraries fall into four
categories: inadequate collections, inadequate
personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of
any practical indexing system to facilitate use of
collections that do exist.
  Failure to deal with these problems does not
reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation
to do so and absence of any concerted source of
guidance.  In response to requests for such guidance
PMI has undertaken a community hospital library
development project in co-operation with the
New England Regional Medical Library Service
(NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of
Medicine.  This report is concerned with the first
phase of this project - namely, the formulation of
a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and
journals that can function as the core for a medical
library.
  Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent
to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical
practice, including the basic sciences.  The
specialists, chosen from regions throughout the
country, were requested to recommend two textbooks
and two journals in their area of special interest
that they considered to be the most basic and 
fundamentally useful for practitioners.  It was
also requested that recommendations be made in order
of preference.

The New Industrial State
.A
Galbraith, J.K.
.W
  During the fifties and sixties it had become customary to depict
the economic system of the United States, along with its European
and Japanese counterparts, as an accomplishment unique since the
Creation.  This volume departed from the accustomed cheering.  It
is my impression that the adult reader was always more skeptical
than the economists of the neo-Keynesian nirvana.  Economic life
was not meant to be that easy.  And perhaps some sensed what I here
urge, that what was called success was less what served the
individual than what served the goals of great industrial and
military bureaucracies which had come, the economic myth notwithstanding,
to comprise so large a part of the economic system.  Still, who could
tell that a herald of such news would be welcomed - or even heard.

The New Librarianship A Challenge for Change
.A
Wasserman, P.
.W
  Among the avenues explored were the following: the attractions the
field holds for those now in it and those who might be drawn to it; the
personality of those in the occupation and in its various subfields and
work roles; the characteristics and perspectives of the institutional
administrators; supply and demand facets of the manpower problem;
organizational relationships in libraries and information centers;
library education as a professionalizing and socializing force; and the
implications of network development for manpower planning.  Central to the
study rationale was the notion that librarianship should be viewed not as
a static institution committed solely to traditional objectives, but as one
with the capacity to be responsive to changing environmental requirements.
It was hoped that from the intelligence gathered from these inquiries
certain of the significant dimensions of the field's manpower concerns
would be illuminated and proposals to influence future development
would be drawn.  Thus, while the investigations were in the nature of
more basic research, their ends were committedly pragmatic.

New Patterns of Management
.A
Mityaev, V.A.
.W
  This volume is intended for persons concerned with the problems of
organizing human resources and activity.  It is written especially for those
who are actively engaged in management and supervision and for students
of administration and organization.  It presents a new theory of
organization based on the management principles and practices of the
managers; who are achieving the best results in American business and
government.  It draws also upon research done in voluntary organizations.
  To maintain a relatively consistent orientation, the focus of this volume
is largely on the problems of business enterprises.  People interested in
other kinds of institutions, such as schools, hospitals, labor unions,
professional and voluntary organizations, should, however, experience no
difficulty in applying the general principles of the theory to their
organizations.

Unintentional Duplication of Research
A survey revealing instances of belated discovery of information
in the literature leads to an estimate of what duplication costs
.A
Martyn, J.
.W
  In a letter in New Scientist (vol. 19, p. 148) the rate of duplication of 
research among scientists was said to have been
estimated at about 10 per cent.  The first
systematic attempt to assess the size of this problem, carried out by the Aslib
Research Department, suggests the actual figure is more than double this, and 
the consequent cost to the nation to be measurable in millions of pounds.
  We put questions to 647 scientists engaged in industrial, academic or 
government research, including chemists, physicists, biologists, psychologists
and mathematicians.  One question was: "Have you, during your current research,
discovered in the literature information which you wish you had had at the 
beginning of your project?"  To this, 144 of them (22 per cent) replied that
they had.  Many had made more than one such find, so that the total number of 
instances was 245.

Non-book Materials: The Organization of Integrated Collections
.A
Weihs, J.R.
.B

.W
  This book presupposes a knowledge of book cataloguing and basic cataloguing
principles.  The Dewey decimal classification 9th abridged edition, Sears list 
of subject headings 9th edition, and A list of Canadian subject headings 
together with a form of simplified cataloguing found in many school libraries
have been used on the sample cards.  It must be emphasized that the subject
analysis systems chosen by a particular library for its print collection should
be used for all media.  Because of its school library orientation, this book
distinguishes between essential and optional elements on the catalogue card.
Libraries which require detailed cataloguing will consistently list these options, 
and may wish to augment the description of materials in the collation and in the
notes.  Items necessary for a minimum description and for a complete description
will be subject to further study prior to the next edition of this work.

  Many segments of society are recognizing that
access to information is a vital and fundamental
contemporary need.  To provide optimum access
it is essential to be able to retrieve information
in whatever physical format it is found.  Such
retrieval requires the development of cataloguing
codes that will handle all media, including
diverse kinds of audio and visual materials.
To be most effective these cataloguing guidelines
should be acceptable on an international level and
should have the support of professional organizations
most concerned with these problems.

  In this book I have presented the tests according to the research
design for which each is suited.  In discussing each test, I have attempted
to indicate its "function," i.e., to indicate the sort of data to which it
is applicable, to convey some notion of the rationale of proof underlying
the test, to explain its computation, to give examples of its application
in behavioral scientific research, and to compare the test to its parametric
equivalent, if any, and to any nonparametric tests of similar functions.

A Study of Information Requests for Scientific Research and Design
.A
Malyarenko, D.P.
.W
This paper describes methods of studying information requests on source
information, analyzes results of questionnaire distribution.
On the basis of the questionnaire answers a card file of the subject requests
and list of requests on source information was formed.
Since the study these requests determines the content and purpose of the
information process, the author suggests that the study of requests be the
first phase of information process.

Formulation of Information Requests
.A
Venediktov, Y.P.
Sokolov, A.V.
.W
This article presents the results of a study of the information requests of
inquirers. It was elucidated that engineers spent an average of 10 hours per 
week in search of needed information. Most valuable sources of information are 
theoretical journals. The study showed that "stable life" of theoretical 
journals equals about 12 years and information journals about 5-6 years. Some
recommendations were formulated on how to construct a reference information
collection.

Principles of Studying of Information Requests
.A
Popilova, L.L.
.W
Earlier publications on the study of information requests consisted of
statistical listing of the most usable sources of information.
Lately there is an increasing number of publications which consider the methods
for studying information requests.
Analysis of these publications shows that we can discern two basic tendencies:
studying subfield groups of researchers and groups of researchers, classified
by topical information sources.
Some attempts were made to study information requests in connection with
creative processes, psychology of creativity and also to establish the
purposes of information retrieval and scientific sources of information.

Methodological problems of scientific-technical literature typology
.A
Feldblyum, I.S.
.W
Two causes for inconsistency between a primary document is content and
form are examined.
1) Inconsistency between document structure and structure of its information.
2) Insufficient development of theories of scientific, and technical literature,
   in particular, the typology of primary scientific documents.
It is suggested that the concept of genres of scientific-technical literature
be introduced, based on the degree to which the material is generalized.
Five basic genres are examined:  technical reports, articles, monographs, text-
books and reference works.
The practical application of a typology of scientific and technological
literature is shown to be possible.

In scientific process and primary scientific documents there are objective
characteristics, which allow the accurate and unambiguous reflection of
the form and content of primary statements n the informational analysis of
their secondary pattern.
Using these characteristics allows one to develop a model of standardized
bibliographic and abstract document description and minimize subjectivity in
information analysis.
  The objective characteristics of form and content of documents and corresponding
elements of bibliographic and abstractive description must be based on
application of classification schemes.
For each characteristic there must be a corresponding scheme of particular
structural complexity.

system compatibility are discussed.. A sine qua non of network functioning
is an integrated retrieval language.. Descriptor languages appear to be most
promising for broad-profile document files.. A descriptor language is conceived
as a complex comprising a thesaurus for terminology control, classifiers for
nomenclature control, and the working dictionaries of the system patrons, 
which comprise fragments of thesaurus and classifiers plus narrowly specialized 
terms as conforming to the file and user needs concerned.. Requirements to a
thesaurus as the core of an information network language are considered..

were revealed in linguistics (Zipf), theory of scientific information 
(Bradford), and in science of science (Lotka), etc.. The identity of the
mathematical essence of various distributions, investigated by many authors on
their own objects of study, is shown..
   The link is considered between the basic probability distribution and some
problems studied in the modern mathematical theory of information.. Examples 
are presented of the use of distribution regularities in various systems

A Standard Format of Progress Reports on Scientific Technical Information
.A
Kruglov, S. L.
.W
   A standard format of progress reports is suggested, based on the experience
of research institutes and drawing offices.. The schedule of reports and each 
of their sections proceed from the need for maximum "noise-resistance" of
reports as used by various categories of users and giving an exhaustive 
description of final and intermediate R&D results.. The author shows that the
difference between the notion of "information value" and of "document value"
dictates a specific approach to organization of the flows of documentary
information, duplication of data in documents of various kind, and to 
development of the logical format and literary style of scientific documents..

Syntagmatic Relations Between Descriptors
.A
Chernyi, A.I.
.W
   Syntagmatic relations (SR) are defined as connections between words that are
established aposteriori and combine these words into phrases and sentences..
The lack of means for recording SR in descriptor languages results in a 
reduction of retrieval precision.. At present, roles and links and the 
evaluation of the extent to which these devices are used are the major devices
used for the description of SR between descriptors in documents' search 
patterns.. An analysis of published results of experiments testing the 
performance of roles and links in 176 descriptor retrieval systems operative in
the USA suggests the conclusion about a poor performance of roles as a 
precision device:  an increase of 10 percent in precision with the aid of roles
is accompanied by a 10 percent reduction of recall.. Links provide for 
approximately the same increase of precision.. The author states the general
requirements to a simple and flexible grammar for descriptor languages, and
show that the approach the suggest ts has been partially implemented in the
information retrieval language for radioelectronics and computer technology
developed at the Institute of Cybernetics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences
in Kiev, and in the SYNTOL (France)..

A Notation for Coding Organic Compounds
.A
Geivandov, E. A.
.W
   A notation for coding organic structures has been developed which provides
for very simple and rational rules of coding the common cyclic fragments..
   The conventional unit used in coding regular structures is benzol ring, and
the skeleton of the regular condensed system is coded using a sequence of even
and odd integers.. The set of rules for coding regular systems might be used as
component of a universal notation for organic compounds.. The code offered by
the author is designed to cover an important and broad class of compounds with
conjugate bonds and it can be used within the framework of a specialized 
computer-based information retrieval system in the capacity of both the input 
and the internal machine language..

The Origins of the Information Crisis:  A Contribution to the Statement

   The different explanations of the nature of the information problems now
facing science and their causes are cited and shown to be debatable.. It is
necessary to give a definition of "information crisis", this widely used 
concept in informatics and the science of science.. The author suggests one
such definition, which reflects the specific historical nature of the possible
manifestations of the crisis.. The "cumulativistic" concept of the progress of
science is criticized as it rules out the possibility of finding the true
causes of the information crisis.. The major cause is asserted to lie with the
nature of the contemporary social production.. An approach to studying into
the origins of the problem is suggested..

The Bibliography of Operational Research
.A
Kendall, M.G.
.W
  In his book on Documentation (1948) the librarian, S.C. Bradford,
discussed certain regularities in the pattern of distribution of articles on 
a particular subject over different journals.  He gives as examples the
distributions for geophysics from 1928-31 inclusive and lubrication for
1931 to June, 1933, inclusive.  The typical picture is one in which, to a
bibliography covering a certain short term of years, a few journals contribute
a large number of articles, more journals contribute fewer and so on in
a monotonic sequence ending with a large number of journals contributing
one article each.  Patterns of this kind have been observed by several
authors, but Bradford was the first, I think, to advance an explanation of
the effect in bibliographical terms.

Operations Research:  Implications for Libraries
.A
Bookstein, A.
Swanson, D.R.
.W
  Library operations in recent times have been characterized by a great
increase in complexity.  The rapid expansion of collections, both in size
and scope, the great variety of forms taken by items that now must be housed
in the library, and the growth in expectations among library users are
among the factors that have contributed to this complexity.  In this setting,
managerial decision making in the library has become an unenviably difficult 
task. Furthermore, the new technologies and new techniques which offer great
opportunities for library planners and  managers make even more difficult the 
use of traditional, intuitive approaches.  It is reasonable to ask whether 
techniques such as Operations Research (O. R.) that have proved valuable in 
similar situations for business and government, might not also be of service 
in libraries.

Compact Book Storage in Libraries
.A
Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F.
.A
Cox, J. Grady
.W
   A method is developed for optimally shelving inventory items by size, with
particular reference to large library collections..  The area presented by n+1
distinct shelf heights is minimized for any collection that can be 
characterized by an item-height distribution.. When item-height is continuous,
the necessary conditions for the extremum are recursive in the optimal shelf
heights, and the solution reduces to a simple computational search.. For 
certain distribution functions, as demonstrated in the example, an additional
recursive relation between the solutions for different n further simplified 
the computation considerable.. Geometrical representations of both the model and 
the solution method are presented.. The maximum increase in storage capacity 
can be expressed generally as a simple function of the mean and the maximum
item-height..

Experimentation in the Theory of Linguistic Description
.A
Melchuk, I.A.
.W
The principle tool for the study and description of natural languages used in
this book are working models of the type "Sense <-> Text".
The similar model for a given actual language is a completely organized sum
of rules whose purely mechanical application should ideally allow one to:
1) go from the given text in the language being studied to the formal description
   of the sense of that text, i.e., to its semantic representation (= semantic
   notation)
2) go from a given meaning, i.e., from a given semantic representation to a
   text (in the language being studied) which will convey the same meaning.
If the proposed meaning may be expressed in more than one way, then all the
appropriate synonymous texts should be constructed.

Organization and Environment Managing Differentiation and Integration

Lawrence, Paul R.

Lorsch,Jay W.
.W
   What organizational characteristics are required to deal effectively with
different external market and technological conditions?  This is the central 
question which this book addresses.. Such a question is quite different from
the central theme of most earlier organizational studies, which have tended
to focus on the question of what is the one best way to organize, irrespective
of the external environmental conditions facing the business.. In this 
important respect this study breaks new ground.. Nevertheless, it draws
heavily on earlier studies in the field of organization behavior at Harvard
Business School and elsewhere, as well as the related literature of the 
behavioral sciences.. The authors not only report the findings of a comparative
study of ten organizations with different levels of economic performance in 
three distinct industrial environments, but also use these findings to unravel
some of the apparent contradictions in current organization theory.. A 
discussion of the implications of these findings for the design and 
administration of large organizations in relation to their specific market and
technological environments is also included..

Organizations
.A
March, J.G.
.W
    This book is about the theory of formal organizations.  It is
easier, and probably more useful, to give examples of formal organizations
than to define the term.  The United States Steel Corporation is a formal
organization; so is the Red Cross, the corner grocery store, the New York
State Highway Department.  The latter organization is, of course, part of
a larger one - the New York State government.  But for present purposes
we need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawn
around an organization or the exact distinction between an "organization" and
a "nonorganization."  We are dealing with empirical phenomena, and the world
has an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into clean
classifications.
    Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with which
they are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged.
We cheerfully make this claim for organization theory.  However much
organizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives and
administrators, and however many books for these practitioners have 
been written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificant
place in modern social science.  Most current psychology and
sociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the
subject of formal organizations.  The Handbook of Social Psychology
(Lindzey, 1954) contains chapters on small groups, mass media, "industrial
social psychology" (with only passing references to organizations),
leadership, and voting behavior.  There is no comparable chapter on
formal organizations, and only scattered reference to them throughout
the text.

Organizations in Action Social Science Bases of Administrative Theory
.A
Thompson, J.D.
.W
    This book might be considered a conceptual inventory.  This is a
departure from the recent fashion of conducting "propositional
inventories," which assumes that important relationships have already been
explored (Berelson and Steiner, 1964).  I assume merely that the concepts
relevant to important relationships exist, and once having identified some,
I hope to generate potentially significant propositions.  We lack the
systematic evidence that eventually must come, but there are illustrative
studies cited to indicate that the propositions which are neither time- nor
space-bound.
    I assume that there are differences among organizations, and hope
to account for some of them.  But I also assume that there is not a one-
to-one correspondence between significant organizational differences and
the typical categories of business, government, medicine, and education.
Likewise, I believe there is not a direct correlation between the academic
disciplines and useful categories of complex organizations.

Organizing Nonprint Material
.A
Daily, T.E.
.W
  The object of this book is to establish a means for organizing
collections of nonprint material so that greatest efficiency can match
most effective service.  No lesser goal is worthy of consideration.
In discussing the problems of organization, the examples of material
have been used to explain differences in treatment that can be made
responsive to the needs of the community that the library serves.
Nonprint material is a vital part of a modern library of whatever
type.  School libraries have made the greatest use of the material so
far, to the point of becoming media-centers, but the avalanche of
information is not only in print form and the need for information
may often be satisfied only by nonprint material.

Out of the Dinosaurus; the evaluation of the National Lending Library for
Science and Technology
.A
Houghton, B.
.W
  The establishment of the National Lending Library for Science
and Technology (NLL) has been one of the most significant events
in British librarianship in the twentieth century.  This book attempts
to trace the development of the library up to its merger into the
impending British Library, and to describe the philosophies which
shaped its policies and services.  I hope that the book will be of
value to British and overseas librarians as a case study of the
development of a national library, and also to students of librarianship
and information work in that it may help them to appreciate the context
in which the library has evolved and in which it now operates.

Epstein, A. H.

   BALLOTS ("Bibliographic Automation of Large Library Operations Using  a 
Time-sharing System") is an on-line system that assists book processing in the
Acquisition and Catalog departments of the Stanford University Libraries.. The
library staff use video (cathode ray tube or "CRT") terminals to perform a
variety of functions involving several computerized files, and as a result of
this on-line activity, the system updates the files and uses data from them to
print the library outputs overnight..

Compaction of Names by X-grams
.A
Walker, Verdon R.
.W
   This paper presents a method for compacting proper given names for computer
storage.. The method presented uses x-grams which are combinations of from one
to eight letters.. Rather than spelling names letter by letter, they are 
"spelled" with x-grams..
   An algorithm as been implemented in a computer program and used to obtain
sets of x-grams for two large (42,165 and 43,875) given name samples.. Using
the x-grams obtained, it was possible to represent the names from one sample in
1.78 bits per original character and in 2.1 bits per original character in the
second sample..

Comparative Effects of Titles, Abstracts and Full Texts on Relevance 
Judgements
.A
Saracevic, Tefko
.W
   Twenty-two users submitted 99 questions to experimental IR systems and 
received 1086 documents as answers, receiving first titles, then abstracts, and
finally full texts.. Ability of users to recognize relevance from shorter
formats in comparison to full text judgement was observed.. Of 1086 answers
evaluated, 843 or 78% had the same judgement on all three formats.. Of 207
answers judged relevant from full text, 131 were judged so from titles and 160
from abstracts.. Parallels between users' and IR systems' performance on 
shorter formats are drawn..

Retrieval of Bibliographic Entries from a Name-Title Catalog by Use of
Truncated Search Keys
.A
Kilgour, Frederick G.
Long, Philip L.
Leiderman, Eugene B.
.W
   An experiment to produce information on the utility of co-ordinating derived,
truncated search keys as enquiry terms to an on-line bibliographic system was
performed on a file of 132,808 name-title entries.. Statistics on the number 
of entries associated with each key for keys varying from four to eight 
characters in length were obtained.. Assuming use of a keyboard cathode ray 
tube terminal capable of displaying at least ten lines of text, and taking
spelling error probabilities into account, a derived key consisting of the 
first three characters of author name concatenate with the first three  
characters of title was determined to be effective for at least four-fifths of
all academic libraries..

Retrieval of Single Entries from a Computerized Library Catalog File
.A
Kilgour, F.G.
.W
        The major intellectual challenges confronting an architect of a total
computerized library system is organization of a efficient file of millions of
bibliographic references from which a single entry can be retrieved swiftly
and uniquely.  Research on file organization has concentrated on retrieval of 
multiple entries possessing some equal or similar characteristic.  However, a
basic library bibliographic file should be organized to yield a record unequal
and dissimilar to all others.  Such a file is analogous to the familiar main
entry catalog, which every library maintains, and would have associated with
it supplementary index files of subjects, titles, call numbers, and perhaps 
other attributes.

Proceedings.  Conference on Interlibrary Communications and Information Networks
.A
Becker, J.
.W
  Librarians and information scientists are vitally concerned
with network development for a number of important reasons.
First, the network concept implies removal of all geographic
barriers to knowledge; this is made possible by advances in
telecommunications technology.  Second, a network implies
equal access by any individual for any purpose to the sum total
of the nation's knowledge resources; this has been a long-standing
educational goal.  And third, a network implies positive
redirection of the basic professional goals and objectives of
librarianship and information science.

  In the following pages a co-winner of the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics
presents a novel study of one of today's most precious commodities -
scientific productivity.  The author not only measures the variations
that exist between different research workers, he also explains these
differences and draws some specific conclusions about the relationship
of salary to productivity.  PROCEEDINGS readers will find this an
especially timely ad significant discussion, particularly in view of
the present widespread concern about manpower shortages and proper
utilization of scientific personnel.

Communication and Epidemic Processes
.A
Goffman, W.
Newill, V. A.
.W
   It is pointed out that communication processes can be represented as 
epidemic processes.. Consequently, epidemic theory can be applied to the
study of any process in which information is transmitted within a population.. 
The members of such populations need not be human beings but could be
micro-organisms or even machines.. The fundamental notion of stability of an
epidemic process is introduced and a stability theorem is derived.. A 
mechanism, called an information retrieval process, which instigates an epidemic
process is defined, certain general properties of the mechanism are established 
and the means of controlling it are discussed.. Pontryagin's maximum principle
is applied to the problem of achieving optimal control of an epidemic process 
and it is shown that stability of the process is equivalent to stability in the
sense of Lyapunov.. This result makes it possible to determine the conditions 
for stability without knowledge of the solution of the differential equations
which represent the process..

Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis
.A
Duda, R.O.
.W
  Our purpose in writing this book has been to give a systematic account of
major topics in pattern recognition, a field concerned with machine recognition
of meaningful regularities in noisy or complex environments.
  The most prominent domain-independent theory is classification theory, the
subject of Part I of this book.  Based on statistical decision theory, it
provides formal mathematical procedures for classifying patterns once they
have been represented abstractly as vectors.
  Attempts to find domain-independent procedures for constructing these
vector representations have not yielded generally useful results.  Instead,
every problem area has acquired a collection of procedures suited to its
special characteristics.  Of the many areas of interest, the pictorial domain
has received by far the most attention.  Furthermore, work in this area has
progressed from picture classification to picture analysis and description.
Part II of this book is devoted to a systematic presentation of these topics
in visual scene analysis.

Patterns in the Use of books in Large Research Libraries
.A
Fussler, H.H.
.W
        The accumulative growth, without limit in ultimate size, of the
general research library must produce stresses and strains that many
institutions will find difficult to resolve.  The rising costs of space
for library buildings and bookstacks; the scarcity of centrally located
campus land; aesthetic and functional limitations on the heights, bulk,
and areas of library buildings; and increasing complexity in the organization
of materials and services for the efficient use of large research collections,
are illustrative of some of these stresses and strains.

Perceptions
An Introduction to Computational Geometry
.A
Minsky, M.
.W
  The goal of this study is to reach a deeper understanding of some
concepts we believe are crucial to the general theory of computation.
We will study in great detail a class of computations that make
decisions by weighing evidence.  Certainly, this problem is of
great interest in itself, but our real hope is that understanding
of its mathematical structure will prepare us eventually to go
further into the almost unexplored theory of parallel computers.

Personnel Administration in Libraries
.A
Stebbins, K.B.
.W
    Since 1958 when the first edition of the present work was
issued, additional studies, research programs and experimentation
have contributed to changes in personnel work and the large area
of human relations.  The impact of these developments has been
and should be felt in libraries as well as in industry, government
and business.  The present edition views all the aspects of personnel
work in the context of the most useful of the newer developments.

Personnel Utilization in Libraries
A Systems Approach
.A
Ricking, M.
.W
  In the late 1960s nearly all professions in the United States thought
they faced severe shortages of manpower in their fields, both in professional
and supporting areas.  Librarianship was not immune: there was more work to be
done than existing staffs could do; there were budgeted professional vacancies
that could not be filled.  And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly
expressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed
utilization of existing manpower.
  It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, then
president of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committee
on Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignments
and to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing
professional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a few
libraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers
that they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that a
need was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem could
be more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois might
have national implications, and that the resources for such a study should be
sought.

   The model of a technical information system described there by Dr. Kessler 
involves a working literature taken from twenty-one journals in the field of
physics.. The system, designed and constructed at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology as a prototype operating in a realistic test environment, uses 
remote consoles having access to a time-sharing computer facility.. Programs
have been developed for a large variety of search and processing techniques in
real time as well as for delayed output.. The work is supported by the National
Science Foundation and in part by Project MAC, the experimental computer 
facility at MIT which is sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency..

Keeping up with What's Going on in Physics 
AIP's Current Physics Information program offers new products

.A
Herschman, A.
.W
  In 1966, AIP had a modest program in physics information supported by the
National Science Foundation.  The program went back several years, and
AIP was considering a major expansion. The first task faced in such an
expansion was to augment the staff so as to be interdisciplinary in physics,
computer operations and scientific information.  The staff would be able
to analyze and extend the studies made at AIP and elsewhere, and would 
formulate a basic approach.

Is Journal Publication Obsolescent?
.A
Pasternack, S.
.W
  Orderly communication through research journals may be jeopardized by a
developing national information system that is beginning to encroach on the
domain of the primary publication system.  The author also believes mass
distribution of unedited, unreferred and often unproofed preprints, which
has recently been proposed, would put journals out of business or transform
them into depositories.

Is There a Pecking Order in Physics Journals?
Analysis of close to a million citations puts
Physical Review at the top of the list, but the order
changes when we adjust for "impact" and "immediacy."
.A
Inhaber, H.
.W
  When physicists wish to communicate their work by means of publication,
several considerations are weighed before choosing the appropriate journal.
There is the matter of audience; of the probable delay between acceptance
and publication; of article format (letter, review, standard research report).
If the article is potentially controversial, the author may estimate its 
chances of being accepted by different journals. Considerations of national 
pride may sway the choice:  An author may submit a work to a journal in his 
own country rather than to one that has a greater circulation and impact but 
is published in a foreign country.

The Planning of Academic and Research Library Buildings

Metcalf, K.D.

  This volume deals with the planning of academic
and research library buildings.  Library buildings
house library collections of various kinds, chiefly
books and other printed matter; seating accommodations
and other facilities for library users; quarters for
the library staff that acquires, catalogues, and serves
the collections; and, in addition, architectural or
what is preferably known as non-assignable space.
(If there if space left over after caring for the
above needs, it is sometimes assigned for other
purposes.)

Planning the College and University Library Building:
A book for campus planners and architects
.A
Ellsworth, R.E.
.W
  This book is intended to help campus planners, architects,
and librarians in the early stages of the planning process.
  Three aspects of the problem deserve more careful treatment
than they have received.  These are: the effects of automation
and electronics on planning; the overall organization of service
patterns; and, the relevance of other audiovisual learning media.
  This is a book about the planning process, not the details
of all parts of a building.  It will not tell you which floor
covering is best, which light fixtures to use or which kind of
library shelving to buy.  These matters are treated in detail
by Metcalf.  It will, however, try to tell you how to go
about solving these and the many other problems planners face.
  Wherever it seems relevant and proper, I have included 
sketches to illustrate the point under discussion.  For the
simplicity of these illustrations, I beg the indulgence of the
reader.

Plans and Structure of Behavior
.A
Miller, G.A.
.W
    The notion of a Plan that guides behavior is, again not entirely
accidentally, quite similar to the notion of a program that guides an
electronic computer.  In order to discover how to get the Image into
motion, therefore, we reviewed once more the cybernetic literature
on the analogies between brains and computers, between minds and
programs.
    Our fundamental concern, however, was to discover whether
the cybernetic ideas have any relevance for psychology.  The men
who have pioneered in this area have been remarkably innocent
about psychology - the creatures whose behavior they want to
simulate often seem more like a mathematician's dream than like
living animals.  But in spite of all the evidence, we refused to 
believe that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or 
even an advantage.  There must be some way to phrase the new ideas so 
that they can contribute to and profit from the science of behavior 
that psychologists have created.  It was the search for that favorable 
intersection that directed the course of our year-long debate.

The Practice of Management
.A
Drucker, P.F.
.W
  We have available today the knowledge and experience needed
for the successful practice of management.  But there is probably no
field of human endeavor where the always tremendous gap between
the knowledge and performance of the leaders and the knowledge
and performance of the average is wider or more intractable.  This
book does not exclude from its aims the advancement of the frontier
of knowledge; it hopes, indeed, to make some contribution to it.
But its first aim is to narrow the gap between what can be done and
what is being done, between the leaders in management and the
average.

PRECIS:  a manual of concept analysis and subject indexing
.A
Austin, D.
.W
  In 1951, the British Bibliography introduced the relatively new technique
of chain indexing to British libraries.  Twenty years later, with chain
procedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered
a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first
issues of 1971.
  To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider
these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling
bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Two
forces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject
indexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; 
secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange
networks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example.
  In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of
subject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be
dominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified
by the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabetical
file.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good deal
of Cutter's "Rules for a dictionary catalog" is devoted to the problem of 
identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting
it as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion of
natural language, and the production of inverted headings.  The unselected
component would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer also
created a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headings
would be co-extensive with the subject of the document.

Prejudices and Antipathies:
A tract on the LC subject heads concerning people
.A
Berman, S.
.W
        Since the first edition of Library of Congress subject
headings appeared 60 years ago, American and other libraries
have increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority --
if not the sole basis -- for subject cataloging.  There can
be no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a
labor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about its
value as a global standardizing agent, a means for achieving
some uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic.
Undoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as to
ordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headings
in subject catalogs as far removed geographically as
Washington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia.  Knowledge and scholarship
are, after all, universal.  And a subject-scheme should, ideally,
manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and
subsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the
worldwide reading community.  Should, that is.  But in the realm
of headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, with
humanity--the LC list can only "satisfy" parochial, jingoistic
Europeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominally
Christian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortably
situated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largely
domiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the Established
Order, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory of 
Western civilization.  Further, it reflects a host of untenable--indeed, 
obsolete and arrogant--assumptions with respect to young
people and women.  And exudes something less than sympathy or
even fairness toward organized labor and the sexually unorthodox or
"avant-garde."

Principles of Operations Research with Applications to Managerial Decisions
.A
Wagner, H.M.
.W
  This book is written primarily for college students who have no previous
background in operations research and who intend careers as administrators,
consultants, executives, or managers in business, nonprofit enterprises, or
government.  The broad topic coverage also should make the text helpful for
students who seek careers as teachers and researchers as well as for 
practitioners who desire an up-to-date review of operations research.  The
book can be used in half-year or full-year introductory courses for juniors,
seniors, or graduates in business, economics, and engineering curricula.
  The central goal of the book is to answer the question, "What are the
fundamental ideas of operations research?"  The text does not presuppose any
advanced training in business administration, industrial engineering,
mathematics, statistics, probability theory, or economics.  Therefore, the
main ideas do not rely on the reader's being expert in these areas.  The
text does assume, however, that the reader is not entirely naive about such
subjects.

Problems in Organizing Library Collections
.A
Hickey, D.J.
.W
    In the area of library work often called "cataloging" and, more broadly,
"technical services," the student may fall into two errors: that of assuming
that all work is strictly routine and mechanical, and that of viewing the tasks
of organizing a library collection as self-contained.  One purpose of the case
studies here presented is to help correct both these errors, and to do so
by illuminating some of the ways in which interpersonal relations affect the
character of the routines and by setting the organizational tasks in the broader
context of the total library situation.

On one model of semantic information theory
.A
Shreider, Y.A.
.W
Text processing problems (such as automatic translation and automatic
abstracting) create a need for defining explicit concepts, which should be
characterized as the properties and quantity of semantic information
contained in document texts.
In fact, we need a formal model, which lets us describe the process of
semantic text analysis.
  Semantic text analysis could be described from the point of view of someone
with a different "conception of the world" - e.g. the text of very meaningful
article does not contain, in fact, any information for people who are not
specialists in the given mathematic field.
Therefore, the formal model must contain descriptions of the "conception of the
world: of the given observer.
Such a description we call a thesaurus.
  Semantic text analysis we interpret as changing the thesaurus in response
to a given text.

Production and Distribution
.A
Machlup, F.
.W
  Anything that goes under the name of "production and distribution"
sounds as if it clearly fell into the economist's domain.  An analysis of
"knowledge," on the other hand, seems to be the philosopher's task,
though some aspects of it are claimed by the sociologist.  But if one
speaks of the "communication of knowledge in the United States," the
specialist in education may feel that this is in his bailiwick; also the
mathematician or operations researcher specializing in communication
theory and information systems may prick up his ears.  In fact, some of
the knowledge to be discussed here is technological, and thus the
engineer may properly be interested.  When I tried out the title of this
study on representatives of various disciplines, many were rather surprised
that an economist would find himself qualified to undertake this kind of
research.

The Application of Microform to Manual and Machine-readable Catalogues
.A
Buckle, D. G. R.
French, Thomas
.W
   At Birmingham University Library it is proposed to implement in October 
l972, a complete microfilm catalogue system.. This system originated from two 
sources.. Over the past two years various means have been evaluated of
converting the library's card catalogues (which were closed at the end of 1971)
to a more compact form.. An interim report mentioned microfilming as one of a 
number of possibilities.. At the time the production of hard copy was 
envisaged, but since then a true microform system has seemed preferable, in 
which the catalogue would exist as cassettes of film to be viewed by all users
on reader machines.. This system has been specified and costed, and details are
included in this paper.. The impetus in reaching this viewpoint was provided by
the progress made over the last 18 months in the field of COM, which rapidly
commended itself as the choice of output medium for the new mechanized 
MARC-based catalogue, which covers all the library's serials and all 
monographs acquired after January 1972.. BLCMP union catalogues in these
categories will also be held in COM form at Birmingham University Library..

Book Selection from MARC Tapes: a Feasibility Study
.A
Wainwright, Jane
Hills, Jacqueline
.W
   The technical and economic feasibility of providing selective notifications
of current books to specialized libraries by extraction from MARC tapes has 
been explored.. An experimental on-line system 'MARCAS' was used to test profile 
construction and the utility of the various elements in MARC records as search
keys.. The programs allowed both weighted and Boolean searching on the title  
and author, LC classification and subject headings, and the BNB Precis indexing
terms and Reference Index Numbers.. Test profiles were constructed for nine
libraries covering a range of subject fields, and run on six weeks of BNB and 
six weeks of LC MARC tapes.. The output was assessed for relevance and recall,
and the results analyzed in terms of precision and recall for various 
combinations of searchable fields.. The best performance, with recall and
precision both about 50%, was given by searching all verbal fields together - 
title and author, LC subject headings, and (BNB tapes only) Precis indexing 
terms.. Costs for the experimental on-line system, and a batch version of the
system, are identified..

Prolegomena to Library Classification
.A
Ranganathan, S.R.
.W
  Even while Edition 2 was under preparation, seeds had been
sown to take the study of the Theory of Classification to a deeper
level with the co-operation of a wider circle of workers.  An
International Conference of Libraries and Documentation Centres was
held in Brussels from 11 to 18 September 1955.  During the Conference,
a whole forenoon was devoted to a Group Meeting on "Classification,
General and Special", under my Chairmanship.  The following two
resolutions recommended by the Group Meeting were adopted by the
Plenary Meeting on 16 September 1955.
  "1 The FID recommends that a deeper and more extensive study 
should be made of the general theory of classification, including
facet analysis, and also of their application in the documentation
of specific subjects.
  "2 The Commission proposes, that in liaison with the FID/CA
Committee, a permanent Working Group be created in order to make
mutual exchange of theoreticians' experiences and points of view
possible.  The rapporteurs shall bring about the creation of such a
group and furnish the information and means of work in order that
practical results may be obtained in the shortest time, by making
mail exchanges easier and more frequent.  The scheme proposed by Dr.
Ranganathan will serve as the basic document" [154].  Further,
at its meeting held on 16 September 1955, the Council of FID requested
its Bureau to convene an International Seminar on Classification.
This was in accord with the memorandum prepared by me at the request
of Donker Duyvis [133].

The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two:
Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information
.A
Miller, G.A.
.W
  My problem is that I have been persecuted by an integer.  For seven years
this number has followed me around, has intruded in my most private data, and
has assaulted me from the pages of our most public journals.  This number 
assumes a variety of disguises, being sometimes a little larger and sometimes a
little smaller than usual, but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable.
The persistence with which this number plagues me is far more than
a random accident.  There is, to quote a famous senator, a design behind it,
some pattern governing its appearances. Either there really is something 
unusual about the number or else I am suffering from delusions of persecution.

A Theory of Human Motivation
.A
Maslow, A.H.
.W
  The present paper is an attempt to formulate a positive
theory of motivation which will satisfy these theoretical
demands and at the same time conform to the known facts,
clinical and observational as well as experimental.  It
derives most directly, however, from clinical experience.
This theory is, I think, in the functionalist tradition of
James and Dewey, and is fused with the holism of Wertheimer,
Goldstein, and Gestalt Psychology, and with the dynamicism of
Freud and Adler.  This fusion of synthesis may arbitrarily 
be called a 'general-dynamic' theory.

Multidimensional Scaling by Optimizing Goodness of Fit to a Nonmetric
Hypothesis
.A
Kruskal, J. B.
.W
   Multidimensional scaling is the problem of representing n objects 
geometrically by n points, so that the interpoint distances correspond in some
sense to experimental dissimilarities between objects.. In just what sense 
distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in
most approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete.. Our
fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically
related.. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness
of fit to this hypothesis.. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to 
compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit..
A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a
companion paper..

An Essay Concerning the Social Dimension of Science
.A
Ziman, J.M.
.W
  Natural Science, whose internal development for three
centuries is so uniform, well-documented and relatively self-
generating, is an obvious candidate for such treatment.  And
having noticed the intellectual connections between the ideas
of various scholars, we must surely pass on to an investigation 
of the social relations through which those connections are
established.  How do scientists teach, communicate with, promote,
criticize, honour, give ear to, give patronage to, one another?
What is the nature of the community to which they adhere?

Public Libraries in Cooperative Systems; Administrative patterns for service
.A
Gregory, R.W.
.W
  This book was written as an introduction to the administrative
relationships between small and medium-sized public libraries
and the cooperative library system.  In this book, the definition
of a cooperative system is as follows:  A cooperative library system
is the combining of the talents and the resources of a group of
independent libraries, within a reasonable geographic radius, for
the purpose of attaining excellence in service and resources for
the benefit of the actual and potential users of all the member
libraries.  The plan for the book originated with questions directed
to a public library administrator and to a system director.  The
most pertinent of the repeated questions was, "How does system
membership change local library administration?"  The sharpest
question was, "Will the system ultimately take over local rights and
responsibilities?"

Public Libraries as Culture and Social Centers:
the origin of the concept
.A
Davies, D.W.
.W
        This book is an attempt to trace the origins of non-
book activities in public libraries, by which is meant the
arrangement of fiestas, festivals, and exhibitions; the
conduct of classes, contests, lectures, and excursions; the
staging of plays, the exhibition of movies, the demonstration
of karate and judo, and all similar activities not primarily
concerned with books now carried on by public libraries.
Since ideas about libraries, as well as librarians, have
passed back and forth across the Atlantic with great facility,
in this attempt to discover origins it seems wise to follow,
however sketchily, developments in both America and Britain,
and to note with some care what was happening in scholarly
libraries, in popular libraries for the middle classes, and
in libraries intended for the working classes.

Book Committee.  Not all the papers delivered at the Symposium are
included, and papers by Banfield, Blasingame, and myself were written
especially for this volume.  The authors are urban social scientists,
economists, historians, sociologists, political scientists, planners,
communication experts, library scholars, and library administrators.
The papers are about libraries and cities, and their main purpose is
to raise issues about the character of cities and the future of libraries

Public Library Legislation
.A
Gardner, F.M.
.W
  Since its inception Unesco has engaged in activities designed to
promote the expansion and improvement of public library services
as a living force for popular education and international understanding.
These activities have included public library pilot projects -
Colombo (Ceylon), Medellin (Colombia), Delhi (India), Abidjan
(Ivory coast), Enugu (Nigeria) - training of librarians, and meetings
of experts on planning library services.  It has become increasingly
evident that effective public library services cannot be developed
and maintained without appropriate legislation providing for a nation-wide
service, offering, as far as possible, equal contract with the
International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA), for a comparative
study of existing library legislation that would be helpful to developing
and developed countries alike in drafting legislation.

The Public Library in the United States
.A
Leigh, R.D.
.W
  The study as a whole is designed to stimulate public librarians
to re-examine realistically their most useful function and greatest
potential contribution at a time when methods of communication
are undergoing rapid change.  As the traditional custodian of the
printed word, the librarian has long had a distinctive and widely
accepted role.  The Public Library Inquiry, especially in the concluding
chapter of the present volume, brings to the center of attention problems
and suggestions for change challenging a fresh appraisal.  It should
arouse the interest of the public served by the libraries as well as aid
the librarians themselves to an appreciation of an important American
institution that must be kept ever alert to the needs of a democratic
society.

  The purpose of this study is to report on the viability of the journals' 
system for communicating scholarly and research information.  Overall it
examines the economics of the interaction between the publisher and library
components in this system and seeks to identify the separate and interdependent
problems of each.  Data have been collected for the five-year period 1969-73
as a basis for analysis and interpretation.  Emerging issues and trends are 
identified and evaluated for their possible future impact.  When supported by
data and information derived from the study, conclusions and recommendations
are offered, aimed at possible solutions, or processes for stabilizing the
present deteriorating situation and the consequent drift toward a general
crisis in journal communication.

Quantitative Methods
.A
Hoadley, I.B.
.W
  This Institute was designed both to encourage the use of
quantitative measurement and to teach the techniques necessary
for such use.  It was hoped that an emphasis on statistical
measurement would upgrade administrative and research skills
and thus contribute to more efficient and effective library
management.
  Studies of librarians' academic backgrounds have indicated
a preponderance of humanities and social science majors in
the field.  Too often librarians have had only a few courses in
mathematics, and some actually have a psychological antipathy
toward numbers.  This anti-mathematics syndrome has
kept librarians from taking proper advantage of quantitative
methods.

Rare Book Librarianship
.A
Cave, R.
.W
  Although there is an extensive and enjoyable literature on the subject
of rare books, most of it is concerned with bibliography or book
collecting, and relatively little on the librarianship of rare books
is available.  This book is an attempt to consider some of the problems
of custodianship and exploitation of special collections in libraries;
problems sufficiently different, I believe, to make the concept of rare
book librarianship a valid one.  It is based distantly upon lecture notes
for a course on this subject which was offered to postgraduate students
at Loughborough University.

Rate Distortion Theory
A Mathematical Basis for Data Compression
.A
Berger, T.
.W
        The branch of information theory devoted to situations in which the
entropy of the source exceeds the capacity of the channel is called rate
distortion theory.  The name derives from C.E. Shannon's concept of the
rate distortion function of an information source with respect to a fidelity
criterion, which serves as the cornerstone of the theory.  Rate distortion
theory provides a mathematical basis for the rapidly evolving branch of
communication engineering commonly referred to as "data compression,"
"bandwidth compression," or "redundancy reduction."

Reader in Documents of International Organizations
.A
Stevens, R.D.
.W
  The purpose of this volume is to give an insight into the nature and scope
of the documents of international organizations and to provide information
about the work of documentalists and librarians in making the mass of
information available in these documents available to readers.  All too many
librarians regard government documents and in particular, the documents of
international agencies as esoteric, unlike the usual library materials in
format and publication pattern, and as presenting problems of acquisitions,
control and service so complex and so frustrating that they are best left to
the specialist in documents.  The result is that international documents are
a puzzlement to the general librarian, and a source of frustration to the
ill informed administrator; a situation exacerbated by the present general
tendency of library school curricula to ignore the question of international
documents except for cursory mention in one or at most two sessions of
a general course in government documents to which relatively few students
are exposed.  The information in this volume will allay the fears of the
generalist librarian.  It also provides the data on which to base additional
emphasis on international documents in the library school curriculum.

Reader Instruction in Colleges and Universities
.A
Mews, H.
.W
DEFINITION:  What is 'reader instruction'?  Another currently
used term is 'library instruction', which puts the emphasis on 
the library rather than the reader, and which also suggests to
some that library instruction concerns the training of librarians.
For the purpose of this introductory handbook 'reader instruction'
is taken to mean instruction given to readers to help them make 
the best use of a library, particularly an academic library of
some size and complexity.

Reader in Library Cooperation
.A
Reynolds, M.M.

  This volume is intended as a means of exploration for the practicing
librarian and as a textbook for the library school student.  It will try
to draw attention to significant social, behavioral, theoretical, 
organizational, functional, and operational generalizations about library
interrelationships; and to suggest a sense of the total fabric of the
cooperative endeavor.  It does not aim at identifying and incorporating
the forms and the range of library cooperation in which individual libraries
seek to extend the limits of their separate capabilities.

Reader in Library Service and the Computer
.A
Kaplan, L.
.W
  The selections are intended mainly for students in library schools, and for 
librarians in the field who have not yet made themselves conversant with the
literature of computer-based operations.  This is not a book, to state the 
proposition in the negative, for those who wish to read on the theoretical
aspects of computers.
  The selections are brought together in seven sections.  The first, the
Challenge, includes material on what is expected of librarians in the age
of the computer.
  The second section, Varieties of Response, does not by any means exhaust
developments in American libraries.  It does, I believe, contain representative
descriptions of some of the best work being accomplished.
  The third section, Theory of Management, contains an outstanding article by
Richard DeGennaro of Harvard.  The particular contributions made in this 
article are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this
third section.
  News Services, the fourth section, required a considerable degree of
selection among a wealth of material, and is indicative of the wide variety
of services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer.
The considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the
first selection of this section, while those that follow describe specific
services now being offered, or services in the planning stage.
  The material in the fifth section, Catalogs and the Computer, is on a
subject that has elicited considerable discussion.  The two articles selected
are on two aspects of the subject, namely, filing problems, and comparative
costs.
  The sixth section, Copyright, contains an article from the legal point of
view.  The more traditional library view of copyright has been ably 
represented by Verner Clapp in an article cited in the section on additional
readings.
  The seventh section, Information Retrieval Testing, is a subject which has
excited the attention of but few librarians, yet its influence on subject
indexing could in time prove considerable.

Reader in Medical Librarianship
.A
Sewell, W.
.W
  Each kind of librarianship partakes of the general elements of librarianship,
and each has a flavor all its own.  This book is intended to present the flavor
and philosophy of medical librarianship to the student or novice.  If it gives
a new perspective to some practicing librarians or administrators in health
science organizations, so much the better.
  If it were ever possible to think of medical libraries in isolation, it is
so no longer.  One must conceive of them as part of a medical system, and
indeed as part of a system that goes beyond the narrow confines of medicine
as practiced by a single physician for a single patient.  It extends into
the health sciences as represented by dentists, pharmacists, nurses,
veterinarians, medical technologists, medical associates and dozens of
others, some not yet possessing a clear identity.  It includes research,
education and practice.  In addition to the clinical sciences, the system
involves the preclinical ones and preventive medicine and public health.
Increasingly, socioeconomic considerations have moved into the mainstream
of medicine.

Reader in Research Methods for Librarianship
.A
Bundy, M.L.
.W
  The fundamental purpose of this volume is to assist its reader to 
genuinely perceive the nature of scholarship and its relationship to
the goals of librarianship.  Viewed in this way, and perhaps as
antidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical
matters of research, the editors' concern here has been less with the
rituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual
inquiry and its societal contribution, with the modes of analysis, the
habits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and
the scholar.
  Another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which
clearly depicts the task of the researcher, and so illuminates realistically
not only the rigor and the discipline, but the human triumphs and joys
which derive from its accomplishment.  Seen thus, as a dynamic field fit
for the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing more
to its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative
capacity, who have not before held this perspective of research.

   This collection attempts to bring together a readable and germane group of
materials ranging from history, review papers, and practical exposition to
reports on current research and development and conjecture about the future.. 
It is expected that these selections will be of interest and use to the 
teacher and student.. It is also hoped that they will be of equal interest to
the professional librarian and researcher.. There has been a deliberate attempt
to exclude materials that have appeared in recently published collections..
It is for this reason that the names of Panizzi, Cutter, Martel, Hanson,
Dewey, Rider, Bliss, Haykin, Shera, Lubetzky and others do not appear.. A
specific focus has been given to this book.. It is in the direction of a 
rational sharing of local, national, and international efforts and the 
eventual coordination and standardization of practices in the technical services
insofar as this is practical..

The Recording of Library of Congress Bibliographical Data in Machine Form
.A
Buckland, L. F.
.W
   This report describes the results of a study of a practical method of 
preparing Library of Congress card catalog data in machine form for (1)
the automatic typesetting of cards and book catalogs, and (2) distribution to 
other libraries throughout the country for all foreseeable bibliographic and
typographic applications of such data, including preparation of local 
catalogs..
   The first step of the method proposed is to type the card data on a
perforated tape typewriter in a way which identifies all of the items on the
card.. After the data is edited and corrected, it is processed by a computer
to form (1) catalog card typesetting tapes, (2) the National Union Catalog,
(3) Library of Congress Books, Subjects Catalog, magnetic tape catalog files,
and a master magnetic or perforated paper tape record copy for distribution..
The procedure also allows the recording of data which does not now appear on
Library of Congress cards, should studies find that the value of the data
exceeds the cost of recording it..
   A demonstration was performed in which cards were typed to produce 
perforated tape records.. These record tapes were automatically converted to a
variety of output forms ranging from phototypeset catalog cards and book
catalog entries to tape typewriter and line printer produced catalog cards..

Relegation and Stock Control in Libraries
.A
Urquhart, J.A.
.W
    Stock control has been defined by Buckland as "the managerial
problem of organising the physical availability of books in relation
to readers".  While it has long been recognised that only a proportion
of the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library 
buildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness with
remarkable speed.  In certain cases some new buildings are full even
before they have left the design-board stage.  It is difficult to avoid
the conclusion reached by R.B. Morris in 1963 that 'in terms of long
range perspective, responsible judgement suggests that there is no
feasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuous
programme of "selective book retirement"'.  Library stock control
has not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy,
time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problems
of acquisition and the provision of an ever-increasing range of services 
for readers.  Early investigations of this issue have tended to be
theoretical and Carol Seymour in her review "Weeding the Collection"
put forward the view that "a librarian should be able to begin his plan
for weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary...
He also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have at
hand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden".  The Pebul Report
summarised the position in a remarkably appropriate metaphor when it
observed that "weeding the bookstock" in academic libraries was the
"ungrasped nettle."

Report on the Testing and Analysis of an Investigation into
the Comparative Efficiency of Indexing Systems
.A
Cleverdon, C.W.
.W
    This volume continues the account of the Aslib-Cranfield project as given
in the "Final Report of the First Stage of an Investigation into the Comparative
Efficiency of Indexing Systems".  The major portion of the two years spent on
this present stage has been involved with the analysis of the considerable
amount of data which was obtained from the main test programme.  A difficulty
in this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likely
to yield valuable information.  In order to keep this volume within reasonable
limits, it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done, and
even so in many cases only brief examples are given.  The major emphasis has been
placed on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents, for this is
considered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and has
not, to our knowledge, been previously attempted.  Of possible equal importance,
but certainly more difficult to evaluate, is the reason for the retrieval of
non-relevant references.  This analysis has not been attempted within the
present work, but will be one of the matters to be investigated in the 
continuation of the project.

The Growth of the Literature of Physics
.A
Anthony, L. J.
East, H.
Slater, M. J.
.W
   An examination is made of the current problems of the communication
and dissemination of literature in the field of physics.. The growth of
the literature is considered quantitatively with respect to the form, subject 
and origin of published material.. This is related to the general growth in 
scientific activity as exemplified by increases in numbers of physicists and of
expenditure on research.. The results of surveys aimed at ascertaining the
needs or demands of users of the physics literature are considered, 
particularly where these reveal weakness in the present organization of
information transfer, and the reactions of users to new services intended to
remedy the deficiencies.. Finally, a number of recently established services -
some designed to meet hitherto unsatisfied needs - are described.. The role of
the computer in the development of local, national and international 
documentation systems is examined..

Research Libraries and Technology
.A
Fussler, H.H.
.W
  The focus of the report is primarily upon the problems of the large,
university, research-oriented library.  It is here that one finds the most
difficult resource-access and bibliographical control problems.  If one can
significantly improve both of these operations for the large, research-oriented
institutions, there are likely to be direct or indirect benefits for the
smaller library, while the reverse situation is much less likely.

Resources and Bibliographic Support for a Nationwide Library Program
Final Report to the National Commission for Libraries and Information Science
.A
Palmour, V.E.
.W
    Foremost among the nationwide goals of the library
community is the access to needed information resources for all
persons in all locations in the U.S.  The perceived right of
individuals to such access provides the foundation for national
information planning.
    For each library, even the largest, the hope of adequately
supplying its identified user groups has been greatly constrained
by simultaneous inflation of both cost and quantity of materials.
While future technological developments may well make possible
on-line full text retrieval of all library materials at local
terminals or the instantaneous remote "publication" of materials
upon demand, the present situation requires more immediate
solutions.

Categories and Relators:  A New Scheme
.A
Perreault, J.M.
.W
  If the (major) premise is accepted, that fully
effective machine-strategization of a retrieval system
depends upon the use of a (hierarchically) structural
(but highly flexible) notation as the equivalent for
the verbal access provided by either unitermic or
articulated conceptual indicators, a faceted classification
logically emerges as the desideratum.
  The two aspects of a structural notation most
determinative here are hierarchicality and uniform
use of general categories (the latter, not merely
for the sake of uniformity as such, but as the means
to a heightened flexibility).  These desiderata could
of course be present on the "idea plane" alone; but
without their being present notationally they do not
furnish, to a mechanized retrieval system, the type
of assistance it requires for optimal functioning.
  The second (minor) premise ought to be that the
Universal Decimal Classification, being both
hierarchical and general-categoric, provides the desired
structurality.  But the melancholy fact is that this
desideratum is not always satisfied, for instance
when UDC uses direct division of a hierarchy when
division by general category would be equally appropriate.

The Ring Index
.A
Patterson, A.M.
.W
  The collection includes (1) simple parent rings and (2) parent systems of
more than one ring in which the rings are united by having one or more atoms
in common.  It thus comparizes simple and "fused" (ortho- and ortho-peri-fused), 
or annelated, systems (including spiro forms),  but not systems like biphenyl
or triphenylmethane, in which the rings are united only by valences or by atoms
not belonging to the rings.  Some systems are included in which a polar valence
is involved, e.g. the four-membered ring of betaine, since these are often shown
in formulas as if true rings; but in such cases the presence of the polar bond
is noted.  Polar bonds in metallic salts (e.g. calcium succinate) are 
disregarded as ring formers; so also are coordinate linkages (as in the chelate
compounds).  The word "system" is used to mean a single ring or a combination of
rings united one to another by atoms common to both.
  Except for some special reason, only systems representing known compounds
of generally accepted structure, or definitely believed by authors to have a
certain structure, are included.  The fact that a compound must have one or two
alternative structures is not sufficient for the entry of a system based on
either of them.  Where there is doubt about an entry a query (?) is inserted
after the reference.

The Rise of Anthropological Theory
.A
Harris, M.
.W
  My main reason for writing this book is to reassert the methodological
priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of
man.  There is an urgency associated with this rededication, which
grows in direct proportion to the increase in the funding and planning
of anthropological research and especially to the role anthropologists
have been asked to assume in the planning and carrying out of international
development programs.  A general theory of history is required if the 
expansion of disposable research funds is to result in something other than
the rapid growth in the amount of trivia being published in the learned
journals.  The publishing of more and more about less and less is an 
acceptable consequence of affluence only if specialization does not lead
to an actual neglect or even obfuscation of fundamental issues.

Why Don't They Ask Questions?

Swope, M.J.
Katzer, J.

  Recently, a great deal of emphasis has been placed upon communications, 
interviewing, and advisory counseling in the field of library
science.  Studies done in these areas have dealt mainly with communication 
barriers, verbal and nonverbal communication, question-negotiation
and patterns of information seeking, interviewing techniques for librarians, 
customer relations, and reference performance as they relate to the
user and his confrontation with a librarian in seeking an answer to his 
question.  However, it seems that few people have been concerned
with the user who for one reason or another, does not ask a librarian for 
assistance.

programs, available for use by industry and government for both private and 
public benefits.  Our group had no part in creating the information resources 
which we use, except for the design of the computer retrieval system.  Although
we work with and depend on conventional libraries and librarians, we have no
professional librarians on our staff.

Rules for a Dictionary Catalog  
.A
Cutter, C.A.
.W
  No code of cataloging could be adopted in all points by every one,
because the libraries for study and the libraries for reading have different
objects, and those which combine the two do so in different
proportions.  Again, the preparation of a catalog must vary as it is
to be manuscript or printed, and, if the latter, as it is to be merely an
index to the library, giving in the shortest possible compass clues by
which the public can find books, or is to attempt to furnish more
information on various points, or finally is to be made with a certain regard
to what may be called style.  Without pretending to exactness, we may
divide dictionary catalogs into short-title, medium title, and full-title
or bibliographic; typical examples of the three being, 1, the Boston
Mercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2, the Boston
Public (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenaeum (1874-82); 3, the
catalog now making by the Library of Congress.  To avoid the constant
repetition of such phrases as "the full catalog of a large library" and
"a concise finding-list," I shall use the three words Short, Medium, and
Full as proper names, with the preliminary caution that the Short family
are not all the same size, that there is more than one Medium, and that
Full may be Fuller and Fullest.  Short, if single-columned, is generally
a title-a-liner; if printed in double columns, it allows the title 
occasionally to exceed one line, but not, if possible, two; Medium does
not limit itself in this way, but it seldom exceeds four lines, and
gets many titles into a single line.  Full usually fills three or four
lines and often takes six or seven for a title.

This book describes exhaustive classification of the declensional types (noun,
adjective, participle, mineral, pronoun) in modern Russian literary language
and rules of formation for all word-forms of any declinable Russian word.
The Description of the Russian declensional system which given in present
monography has great importance, on the one hand, for such practical problems
as the teaching Russian and the development of automatic Russian text
synthesis; and, on the another hand, for a general-theory of declension and for
the typological study of Slavic languages.

engaged the attention of educators and librarians
none have been more puzzling than those posed by
the astonishing growth of our great research 
libraries.  My own interest in this subject has, 
over several years, resulted in a series of papers,
some of them mainly analyzes, but others of them
endeavoring to suggest answers to what has 
sometimes seemed to be an almost insoluble puzzle.

Science Since Babylon
.A
Price, D.J.D.
.W
  This book had its origin in a set of five public lectures given
at the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University during
October and November 1959 under the auspices of the Yale Department
of History.
  The subject (whatever its name) had just come through
a stage in its growing up during which it almost seemed as
though every would-be practitioner of the art deemed it
necessary to exhibit the completeness of his dedication by
writing the history of the whole of science through all its
periods.  Hoping that this historiographic phase had
evaporated, and feeling incompetent in too many scientific
and historical directions, I resolved instead to essay the
experiment of speaking only from those areas in which I had
reasonable firsthand experience at research.

Is a Scientific Revolution Taking Place in Psychology?
.A
Palermo, D.S.
.W
  My plan in this paper is to try to apply to the field of experimental
psychology the analysis of the characteristics of science (and, more
particularly, the structure of scientific revolutions) as conceptualized by
T.S. Kuhn.  Kuhn has not been accepted without criticism, but that need not
prevent us from using his book as a point of departure for discussion.  I assume
that the reader will be familiar with Kuhn's analysis,so that only a sketchy
summary of his position is necessary.  I will then take a brief look at some of
the history of psychology, with special emphasis upon the major tenets of
behaviorism.  Finally, I will advance some evidence to suggest that we may well
be living in an era of revolution within psychology (as well as without).

Is a Kuhnian Analysis Applicable to Psychology?
.A
Briskman, L.B.
.W
  As my title might suggest, I wish to discuss some aspects of Palermo's recent
paper.  The thesis which Palermo advocated is that Kuhn's view of scientific
revolution is applicable to the recent history of experimental psychology, and
that, in particular, experimental psychology has had two paradigms already,
with the appropriate scientific revolution between them, and that the current
behavioristic paradigm may well be in a state of Kuhnian crisis.  The
present note is divided into three parts: the first questions Palermo's 
assertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was a
standard Kuhnian paradigm-change; the second, closely tied to the first,
challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as a
Kuhnian paradigm; finally, the third supports Palermo's thesis that behaviorism
is in a 'crisis-state' but advances an alternative account of the reasons for
this.

Bibliographical Statistics as a Guide to Growth Points in Science
.A
Meadows, A.J.
O'connor, J.G.
.W
  Efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies of
scientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements about
trends in science.  For example, there has been a continuing interest in the
question of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on its
age.  These investigations have, however, been mainly concerned with the major
branches of science only, and have also, perhaps, been rather more interested
in identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future.
Although such results are obviously valuable, it is also important to push
these analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subject
division, since such areas may have significantly different bibliographical
properties from the subject average.  One particularly important aspect of
such work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline.
We can specifically pose the question: is it possible, purely from a 
statistical analysis of scientific research papers, to identify the 
appearance of a new growth area and, if so, how soon after its first
appearance can such an area be identified?

The Structure of Scientific Literatures 
II: Toward a Macro- and Microstructure for Science
.A
Griffith, B.C.
Small, H.G.
Stonehill, J.A.
Dey, S.
.W
  Part I of this paper described the first steps in mapping the scientific
literature, using a new technique - co-citation - to measure the degree of
similarity among documents.  The work developed directly from an earlier
paper which defined this measure, and explored its relationship to other
citation measures for identifying relationships among documents.  We now
report the outcome of an attempt to create 'maps' of the scientific literature.
The scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they
present, not only an overview of all highly-cited papers in natural science, but
also a detailed view of a single scientific specialty.  At each level we have
systematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation,
and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects
of the specialty structure of science.

College Libraries and Chemical Education
.A
Gross, P.L.K.
.W
  The small college has stood staunch in its desire to
supply the liberal education and perhaps it has done
well in maintaining this position.  On the other hand,
many of the large universities have shifted the
emphasis from undergraduate work to graduate study.
Still others have tried to develop both side by side.
Few of the small colleges have kept astride with the
inevitable consequences of such a situation.  The
few who have are sending an increasing number of
their graduates to these universities to complete their
training.  As an example of this, it is the boast of
Pomona College that over seventy per cent of her
graduates have taken subsequent professional training.
It has become the evident duty, therefore, of the
small college to prepare its men, not only to enter
such graduate schools, but also to meet successfully
the ever-increasing intensity of competition found
there.  This in addition to supplying a broad
cultural education.  This duty has brought with it
a number of problems of first magnitude.  One of the
biggest of these is the problem of adequate library
facilities.
  It is the purpose of this paper to discuss this
problem with special reference to the student whose
college major is chemistry.

Serial Literature Used by American Geologists
.A
Gross, P.L.K.
Woodford, A.O.
.W
  The present investigation deals with the serial
literature of geology, including mineralogy.  Six
American journals for 1929 were chosen, and the
references tabulated.  In Table I are listed these
source journals, together with the total number of
pages of the actual articles studied, the total number
of citations in each journal, the number of references
to books and to personal communications, and the net
total, which represents the citations to serial
literature.  It is these last mentioned references
which will be considered in further detail.  The
totals are probably slightly high, due to unintentional
counting in single articles of repetitions of the same
citation.

Citation Indexes for Science
.A
Garfield, E.
.W
 In this paper I propose a bibliographic system for science literature that can
eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent, incomplete, or obsolete data by
making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of
earlier papers.  It is too much to expect a research worker to spend an 
inordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of 
antecedent papers. It would not be excessive to demand that the thorough 
scholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers, if they 
could be located quickly.  The citation index makes this check practicable.  
Even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing 
the citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effort
required to compile it.
  This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a 
new approach to subject control of the literature of science.  By virtue of 
its different construction, it tends to bring together material that would 
never be collated by the usual subject indexing.  It is best described as an 
association-of-ideas index, and it gives the reader as much leeway
as he requires.  Suggestiveness through association-of-ideas is offered by
conventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject
heading.

Relative Effectiveness of Document Titles and Abstracts
for Determining Relevance of Documents
.A
Resnick, A.
.W
  Abstract.  Individuals who received documents
through a selective dissemination of information
system were asked to determine the relevance of
documents to their work interests on the basis of 
titles and of abstracts.  The results indicate
that there was no significant difference between
the usefulness of titles and of abstracts for this
purpose.

Quantitative Growth of the Mathematical Literature
.A
May, K.O.
.W
  Since 1868 the number of mathematical publications per year
(measured by counts of titles abstracted) has grown from about 800
to 13,000 at an average continuous compound rate of about 2.5 percent
per year, doubling about four times a century.  Deviations from the
exponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery.  If the
total number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating from
the curve of annual output, the cumulative grand total of mathematical titles
grows from 41,000 in 1867 to 419,000 by the end of 1965.  Deviations from
an exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two
"pauses" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallel
to the theoretical curve.  The well-known hypothesis of exponential
growth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate less
than half that found by Price and other investigators.	The discrepancy appears
to be due to the failure of previous studies to take into account the
titles published before the beginnings of the time series used.

The Matthew Effect in Science
.A
Merton, R.K.
.W
  This paper develops a conception of ways in which certain psychosocial
processes affect the allocation of rewards to scientists for their 
contributions - an allocation which in turn affects the flow of ideas and
findings through the communication networks of science.  The conception
is based upon an analysis of the composite of experience reported
in Harriet Zuckerman's interviews with Nobel laureates in the United
States (1) and upon data drawn from the diaries, letters, notebooks,
scientific papers, and biographies of other scientists.

Computer-Assisted Design of Complex Organic Synthesis
.A
Corey, E.J.
Wipke, W.T.
.W
  This article is concerned with the general theory of chemical synthesis and
with the application of machine computation to the generation of chemical 
pathways for the synthesis of complicated organic molecules.  The basis for 
the approach which has been developed comes in large measure from the methods 
used by chemists in the solution of certain types of synthetic problems.

Psychology:  Apprehension over a New Communications System
.A
Boffey, P.M.
.W
  Dissension has arisen in the American Psychological Association (APA) over a
multimillion dollar plan to establish a "national information system for
psychology."  The plan would supplement the existing psychology journals with
a computerized system for distributing unedited manuscripts on a rapid-fire
basis.

sciences regarding three major factors associated with the 
dissemination and assimilation of scientific information: (i) lags in the 
process of information flow; (ii) the organization and
effectiveness of informal networks; and (iii) the transfer of information from 
the informal to the formal domain.

Selective Dissemination and Indexing of Scientific Information
.A
Schneider, John H.
.W
   Automated methods for selective dissemination of information (SDI) to
individual scientists and engineers play an important role in dealing with the
increasing avalanche of scientific information.. This article presents some
basic aspects of SDI systems and describes recent developments and problems..
Two different approaches to indexing information for SDI systems are discussed,
with emphasis on the desirability of using enumerative hierarchical 
classifications to improve the precision and quality of matching scientists 
with useful documents..

.A
Koch, H. William
.W
   A new concept in science communication will be given its first test in
calendar year 1972.. Primary and secondary contents of a selected subset of 
the world's journal literature in physics will be provided in a variety of
output formats.. Among them are a monthly microfilm containing the full texts
of all articles in the set of journals (Current Physics Microform); an advance
abstracts journal describing the articles (Current Physics Advance Abstracts);
a printed, classified index of the titles of the articles (Current Physics 
Titles); and a computer tape index to the articles (Searchable Physics 
Information Notices)..

Citation Analysis
.A
Gouldsmit, S.A.
.W
  The Science Citation Index is a valuable and powerful tool when
used for the purpose for which it was intended, as an aid in literature
search.  It also invites a variety of statistical investigations, which
must, however, be considered with prudence, since they may lead to
misleading results.  No matter how cautiously the authors express
themselves, the casual readers,  that is the majority, will treat 
the results as established facts and forget about the assumptions
underlying them.  This is also happening with the computer output
for economic models, which is accepted as if it were experimental
observation.

Copyright, Public Policy, and Information Technology
.A
Henry, N.L.

  It is my purpose to single out two major information technologies that
have already fostered considerable controversies - computer-based
information storage and retrieval systems and photocopying technologies -
and analyze the costs and benefits they have produced in various knowledge-
sensitive circles of American society. I also suggest some immediate policy
steps that might be taken concerning computers, photocopiers, and other
information technologies.

Science:  Growth and Change
.A
Menard, H.W.
.W
  More and more examples accumulated of highly variable growth
rates and of their influence on scientific careers.  Gradually the study
began to incorporate calculations of the effects of variable growth on
a wide range of scientific concerns: studying, teaching, research,
publishing, citations, the basis of scientific prestige, promotions,
unemployment.  It became apparent that generally unsuspected forces have
a powerful influence on the careers of scientists and everyone else
enmeshed in rapid change.
  This book presents some evidence for change and speculates about
many effects.  It also makes a beginning toward understanding the
forces that cause and do not cause change.  It may provide some solace
for those in dormant fields who have wondered why life has passed
them by.  It may, perhaps, make a few highly successful scientists a
little more modest.  Most of all it may guide those who still have a
choice - and so have we all.

Science and Information Theory
.A
Brillouin, L.
.W
  A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theory
of information.  It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has
expanded very rapidly.  This new theory was initially the result of a very
practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is it
possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or 
telegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of information
communicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare these
two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of these
problems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication
engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively.
  From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical
and practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations.
Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific
discussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to
show a very direct connection between information and entropy.  The 
thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain
physical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory,
it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle
states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than
the amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negative
entropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  The
generalized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of
information.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments
and is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics.

Two Paradigms for Scientific Knowledge?
.A
Bloor, D.
.W
  The growing interest in the sociology of science makes the publication of
this collection of papers particularly timely because, in broad outline,
it deals with the clash which occurs when the sociological approach makes
incursions into the field normally occupied by philosophers of science.

Is a Scientific Revolution Taking Place in Psychology? - 
Doubts and Reservations
.A
Warren, N.
.W
  We were introduced by Kuhn to the notion of scientific progress as a series
of qualitative changes, each involving the overthrow of a prevailing paradigm
of thought by a new paradigm which alters the whole perspective of a science.
Palermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn's analysis.  It seems, if we judge
by constant citations of Kuhn and the references to paradigms, crises and
revolutions among scientists and philosophers, that he has induced a novel
self-consciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature of
cumulativeness in the expansion of understanding - and not least among
psychologists.  This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one of
psychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: Jean
Piaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that he
is hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades been
developing a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of the
development of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhn
acknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits a
sequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking.

The Structure of Scientific Literatures
I:  Identifying and Graphing Specialities
.A
Small, H.
Griffith, B.C.
.W
  In this paper we report a first experiment using a new computer-based
technique to identify clusters of highly interactive documents in science.  We
contend that these clusters represent the scientific specialties which currently
exhibit high levels of activity.  This technique, we believe, opens the way
to a systematic exploration of the entire specialty structure of science,
including both the internal structure of specialities and their relationship
to one another.

Popper's Mystification of Objective Knowledge
.A
Bloor, D.
.W
For Popper, science is the very epitome of objective knowledge.  The central
papers of his latest book argue and elaborate on this theme.  He says:  
All work in science is work directed towards the growth of objective
knowledge.  We are workers who are adding to the growth of objective
knowledge as masons work on a cathedral.
  I will first make some preliminary points about the word 'objective'.
This will give substance to issues which are in danger of becoming too
rarefied.  Second, I will outline Popper's account of objectivity.  Third,
I will argue that despite the value of what he says, his approach is
seriously misleading.  I will propose a formula for systematically transforming
Popper's theses and exposing what is important in them.  This 'transformative
method' points the way towards an entirely different conception of what makes
knowledge objective.

The Scientific Community
.A
Hagstrom, W.
.W
  This work is concerned with the influence of scientific colleagues on the
conduct of one another's research.  With few exceptions, the discussion is
limited to basic research in experimental sciences with well-established
theories.  In this type of research, the scientific community is relatively
autonomous, and the group of colleagues is the most important source of
social influence on research.  Colleagues influence decisions to select
problems and techniques, to publish results, and to accept theories.

Scientific and Technical Libraries:

  The book is designed to serve multiple purposes.  First the needs of
practicing librarians, particularly those who are just beginning their
careers, and require a general guide and source of operational and
bibliographic information, have been given special consideration.  A
second purpose is to provide a textbook for library school and other
advanced students whose interests are oriented toward the literature of
the life and physical sciences.  The book could also help persons in
management positions of organizations in which the establishment of a
library is contemplated, presenting, if only from a review of the contents,
the scope of such a department.  Finally it should be a good resource for
library consultants engaged in assisting management to make the right
decisions.  The requirements of all of these audiences have been assessed
and endeavor made to meet their somewhat varied requirements.

one of the first major studies to examine the relationship between a 
scientist's performance and the organization of his laboratory.  Unlike many
previous expositions about the best environment for technical people, the
findings resulted from extensive analysis of factual data from a wide
range of research personnel.
  Work progressed over the next four years, and a number of intriguing
results began to emerge.  But as these were discussed with other
investigators studying different kinds of R & D laboratories, discrepancies
appeared.  It became clear that a broader study was needed before one
could be sure what constitutes a stimulating environment for research
personnel.  We set out to design a study in which standardized instruments
would be administered to scientists and engineers in several types of
laboratories.

Selecting Materials
.A
Broadus, R.N.
.W
    In reality, the building and shaping of the collection is the heart of
librarianship, involving the essential philosophy of the profession.  Not
only is it one of the most fascinating tasks in the intellectual world, but
"book selection is the most important, most interesting, and most difficult
of the professional librarian's responsibilities."  True, ready-made lists
of the "best books" need not be ignored, but they have to be evaluated
thoroughly and used only insofar as they prove helpful.

method of lexical semantic research, and textual semantics. Problems 
connected with lexical word meaning, the building up of semantic fields using 
computers, and automatic indexing are considered.

Serial Publications
.A
Osborn, A.D.
.W
  This book has been designed as a theoretical and practical introduction
to the library aspects of serial publications.  These publications are now
so profuse and at the same time so significant for library purposes that
librarians generally should have a good grasp of their nature and of the
modes of controlling them.  Like rare books, serials give rise to frequent
and sometimes intricate technicalities with which not only specialists
but also head librarians, department heads, and others should be acquainted
since serials are part and parcel of the workday library.

Simulation Teaching of Library Administration 
.A
Zachert, M.J.K.
.W
  The underlying concepts of simulation and experimential teaching methods
presented in this book have been borrowed from other fields - business,
governmental and education administration primarily.  The values for library
educators are not hypothetical, however, for the methodology has been
successfully used over a period of time by a number of teachers, and in a
variety of educational settings related to career training for librarians.
Neither is the approach overpersonalized.  Much of the telling is in personal
terms, in order to limit generalization, to induce acceptance of responsibility
and to provide concrete examples in terms of teaching library administration.
The assumption is that it will be easier for library educators to react
creatively to methodological discourse couched in library science terms than
if the same methodology were described in terms of high finance, international
politics, militarism, or secondary school planning.

    The automatic SMART document retrieval system was designed at
Harvard University between 1961 and 1964, and has been operating of IBM
7094 and 360 equipment both at Harvard and at Cornell University for
several years.  The system takes documents and search requests in the
natural language, performs a fully automatic content analysis of the
texts using one of several dozen programmed language analysis methods,
matches analyzed documents with analyzed search requests, and retrieves
for the user's attention those stored items believed to be most similar
to the submitted queries.

Developments in Data Analysis
.A
Armor, D.J.
.W
  The last ten years have witnessed rapid and often radical changes in
computer programming systems for social science data.  At least a dozen
different program packages, collections, or systems (not to mention
hundreds of individual programs) have emerged by now and are in use by
social scientists at universities and research centers all across the
country.  It is probably safe to say that the bulk of these systems
and programs represent the individual efforts of a small group working
at one institution, often operating under a relatively restricted set
of research and computing assumptions.  This parochial tendency has left
students and researchers with the often bewildering and always time-
consuming problem of learning new procedures for processing their data
each time they change institutions (or each time the institution changes
computers).

Armor, D.J.

  The present volume is intended as a systematic, theoretical treatise
in the sociology of knowledge.  It is not intended, therefore, to give
a historical survey of the development of this discipline, or to engage
in exegesis of various figures in this other other developments in
sociological theory, or even to show how a synthesis may be achieved
between several of these figures and developments.  Nor is there any
polemic intent here.  Critical comments on other theoretical positions
have been introduced (not in the text, but in the Notes) only
where they may serve to clarify the present argument.

The Social Function of Science
.A
Bernal, J.D.
.W
  The events of the past few years have led to a critical examination
of the function of science in society.  It used to be believed that
the results of scientific investigation would lead to continuous
progressive improvements in conditions of life; but first the War and
then the economic crisis have shown that science can be used as
easily for destructive and wasteful purpose, and voices have been
raised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the only
means of preserving a tolerable civilization.  Scientists themselves,
faced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectively
for the first time, how the work they are doing is connected with
the social and economic developments which are occurring around
them.  This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; to
investigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, are
responsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible
steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a
destructive utilization of science.

Social Mobility in Industrial Society
.A
Lipset, S.M.
.W
  In the present study, Professors Lipset and Bendix cast doubt
on the validity of a number of widely accepted generalizations
relating to social mobility: particularly (1) that there has been
substantially less mobility in Europe than in the United States,
(2) that social mobility tends to decline as industrial societies
mature, and (3) that opportunities for entrance into the business
elite become more restricted with mature industrialization.  In
a careful analysis of the existing literature, the authors marshal
an imposing array of evidence in support of their major thesis
that social mobility is an integral and continuing aspect of the
process of industrialization.

Social Organization of Hamadryas Baboons
.A
Kummer, H.
.W
  Baboons have adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from West
African rain forests to semidesert areas on the coast of the Red Sea.
While all baboons are morphologically adapted to life on the ground,
some species have become more independent of trees than others.
In a rough ecological series, we find on one end the forest dwelling
West African Species (Mandrillus leucophaneus, M. sphinx, Papio
papio), none of which has so far been studied in the field.  The first
step into open country is realized by the savanna baboons of South
and East Africa, including, from south to north, the species Papio
ursinus, cynocephalus and anubis.  Their social organization and its
ecological context have been subject to long range field work by
HALL (1962 a, b) in South Africa, by DEVORE (1962) in Kenya, and
by ALTMANN and ALTMANN (in preparation) in Kenya ad Tanzania.
In both regions, the groups can range far into the open grassland,
but at night, they withdraw to high trees or, as in the Cape region,
to vertical cliffs.

The Social Psychology of Organizations
.A
Katz, D.
.W
  In our attempts to extend the description and explanation of
organizational processes we have shifted from an earlier emphasis on
traditional concepts of individual psychology and interpersonal
relations to system constructs.  The interdependent behavior of many
people in their supportive and complementary actions takes on a form
or structure which needs to be conceptualized at a more appropriate
collective level.  Classical organization theory we found unsatisfactory
because of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of social
structures.  The development of open-system theory, on the other hand,
furnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework.  Hence, our
effort, in the pages that follow, is directed at the utilization of
an open-system point of view for the study of large-scale organizations.

scientific growth and compared with data from other case studies.

Career Contingencies and the Fate of Sociological Research
.A
Oromaner, M.
.W
  During the past three hundred years the journal article has become
the main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication.
Potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because
they have been published in a reputable journal (Zuckerman and Merton,
1971).  Who published what and where therefore becomes a central 
question in the understanding of scholarly, and in particular
scientific, disciplines.  There have recently been a number of
investigations concerning the career of such publications.  This
career, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages.
1) Pre-publication.  Here the scholar writes the article, circulates
it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal
meetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971).
2) Publication.  Here the article is submitted to one or more journals
for publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971).
3) Post-publication.  Here colleagues either ignore the published
article or reward it through citations to it in their own work.  The
practice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in which
scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline.

"Exit, voice, and loyalty": 
Further reflections and a survey of recent contributions
.A
Hirschman, A.O.
.W
  My book Exit, voice and loyalty: Responses to decline in firms,
organizations, and states was published in l970.  Reactions to it
and applications of its concepts have been fairly numerous and I
have myself had quite a few afterthoughts.  It will therefore be
difficult to bring these matters together in a passably structured
paper.  In the following, I shall limit myself to four broad
areas of inquiry which have been so arranged that my own further
reflections figure rather prominently though by no means exclusively
in the first two sections while the latter two are more heavily
weighted with reports and comments on the research and contributions 
of others.

Social Stratification in Science
.A
Cole, J.R.
.W
  In recent years social scientists have given increased attention to
problems of inequality, justice, and discrimination in American society.
The influence of ascribed statuses on the life chances of individuals
is being studied in an effort to estimate the "fairness" of social
institutions in rewarding talent.  Social scientists are trying to
determine the extent to which so-called "irrelevant" characteristics
influence the ways in which people are judged by social institutions
and eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income,
prestige, and influence.  Of the major institutions in American society,
science has received perhaps the least systematic attention.  Little
is known about how scientists achieve positions of renown.  This book
examines several aspects of a single basic question:  is the stratification
of individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance,
or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment?
A more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whether
universalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis for
recognition in the social system of science.

Moravcsik, M.J.

  We tried to concentrate on a few variables that might define the
nature of a citation, and to keep the rest of the variables constant.  In
particular, we used references in articles in a single journal, in a single
specialty of a single branch of science, and in a narrow time period.
Specifically, we investigated 30 articles dealing with theoretical high
energy physics, and published in Physical Review in the years 1968 to
1972 (inclusive).

The Social System of Science
.A
Storer, N.W.
.W
        This book, is an exercise in sociological theory-
building.  It attempts to develop a theory of the social organization
of science.  I have tried to indicate its possible broader relevance
by pointing out certain basic parallels between the "social system"
of science and other social systems within society.  I hope, further,
that the approach used - even if not the specific conclusions I
have drawn from it - may be useful in bridging the gap that seems
now to exist between those sociologists who are concerned with
society as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms of
its consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists who
are concerned first of all with the motives, attitudes, and goals
of the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior.
My approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that most
individuals, most of the time, come to "want" to do what it is
that society "needs" them to do.  Only when we can answer this
question satisfactorily, can we develop a sociology capable of 
providing both prediction and meaning.

Social Theory and Social Structure
.A
Merton, R.K.
.W
  Of the four chapters, added to this edition, two come from published
symposia,one of which is out of print and the other of which, I am told,
is nearing that same state of exhaustion.
  This chapter sets forth the concept of 'the influential,' identifies two
distinctive types of influentials, the 'local' and the 'cosmopolitan,' and
relates these types to the structure of influence in the local community.
  The second of these chapters, "Contributions to the Theory of Reference
Group Behavior," draws upon the ample evidence provided by The American
Soldier to formulate certain conditions under which people orient themselves
to the norms of various groups, in particular the groups with which they are
not affiliated.
  The other two chapters added to this edition have not been published
before.  The first of these, "Continuities in the Theory of Social Structure
and Anomie," tries to consolidate recent empirical and theoretical analyses
of the sources and consequences of that breakdown of social norms which is
described as anomie.  The second, "Continuities in the Theory of Reference
Groups and Social Structure," tries to bring out some of the specially
sociological, as distinct from the socio-psychological, implications of
current inquiries into reference-group behavior.  The intent is to examine
some of the theoretical problems of social structure which must be solved
before certain further advances can be made in the sociological analysis of
reference groups.

Communication Nets in Science:
Status and Citation Patterns in Animal Physiology
.A
Whitley, R.D.
.W
    By virtue of its peculiar links with the reward system in science,
the communication system plays a central part in the maintenance 
and growth of science.  It is the means by which the individual
scientist relates to the social system:  he publishes his work to
gain recognition, and reads the publications of others to maintain his
knowledge.  The formal communication system also forms the basis for 
the allocation of rewards: instrumental and consumatory.  Thus it is
a means of exercising social control.
    The informal communication system, although important, is the distaff
side.  Its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatory
rewards.  Legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given by
the social system through informal systems of communication, though it is
growing in importance as an information dissemination system.

Problem Areas and Research Networks in Science
.A
Mulkay, M. J. 
Gilbert, G. N.
Woolgar, S.
.W
   A general account is presented of the emergence, growth, and decline of
scientific research networks and their associated problem areas.. Research 
networks are seen to pass through three phases.. The first, exploratory phase 
is distinguished by a lack of effective communication among participants and
by the pursuit of imprecisely defined problems.. The second phase is one of
rapid growth, associated with increasing social and intellectual integration,
made possible by improved communication.. An increasingly precise scientific
consensus gradually emerges from a process of negotiation, in which those
participants who are members of the scientific elite exert most influence.. 
But as consensus is achieved the problem area becomes less scientifically
fruitful; and as the network grows, career opportunities diminish.. 
Consequently, the third, final phase is one of decline and disbandment of the
network, together with the movement of participants to new areas of 
scientific opportunity..

The Seven Sexes: A Study in the Sociology of a Phenomenon, or the 
Replication of Experiments in Physics
.A
Collins, H. M.
.W
   The replication of scientific experiments is discussed stressing the problem
of communication between the originator of an experiment and a scientist
intending to replicate it.. Models of communication are set up, with reference 
to established fields.. A more marginal field is then investigated in the light 
of these models and it is concluded that scientists in the latter field should 
not be seen as engaged in replicating original experiment, but in negotiating
the rules of replication, and hence the nature of the phenomenon under 
investigation..

Some Correlates of a Citation Measure of Productivity in Science
.A
Bayer, Alan E. 
Folger, John
.W
   The Science Citation Index provides an easy way to derive criterion
measures of scientific accomplishment.. Measures derived from citation counts,
the principal criterion, have high face validity.. These criterion measures are
found to have a low but positive correlation with the quality of scientists'
graduate education and no relation to his measured IQ score. Plans for 
future research on the correlates of scientific productivity are briefly
discussed..

Competition and Social Control in Science: An Essay in Theory-Construction
.A
Collins, Randall
.W
   Social control in science operates through the process in which the 
colleague group validates individual scientists' contributions to knowledge to
the laymen who provide support and rewards for science.. Descriptive research
in various areas of the sociology of science may be brought together into a
causal model which relates competitive conditions within colleague groups to
variations in scientific productivity, methods, values, and organizational
structures..

Patterns of Intellectual Influence in Scientific Research
.A
Cole, Jonathan R.
.W
   A widespread conception of the development of science holds that the great
discoveries are a result of the cumulative work of a vast number of 
scientists.. Those historians and philosophers of science who express this
point of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integral
part of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop a
pyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists..
An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible
for advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most of 
the eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and National
Academy members of today, are the "pedestrians" of history..
   This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the
field of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed:  one is drawn
from a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second from
a subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a third
from a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of data 
indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by
various types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that the 
physicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the 
research produced by a relatively small number of scientists.. The implications
of these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areas
for necessary future research are suggested..

Inputs, Outputs, and the Prestige of University Science Departments
.A
Hagstrom, Warren O.
.W
   This paper reports correlates of departmental prestige (American Council on
Education rating of the quality of graduate faculty, 1966) for a sample of 125
departments in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.. The analysis 
mostly uses multivariate linear regression.. Large and significant correlations
with departmental prestige exist for measures of department size, research
production, research opportunities, faculty background (including quality of
PhD university), and faculty awards and offices.. Combinations of from six to
nine indicators of these variables account for about three-fourths of the 
variance in departmental prestige; when other types of variables are held
constant, indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantly
associated with departmental prestige.. Correlations of prestige with rates of
inbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed.. Differences
in the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied.. It is
shown that prestige is correlated with average amount of informal scientific
communication and with departmental morale even after possible confounding
variables are held constant..

Sociology and Modern system Theory
.A
Buckley, W.
.W
  This book is intended as an exploratory sketch of a revolutionary
scientific perspective and conceptual framework as it might be applied
to the sociocultural system.  This point of view and still developing
framework, as interpreted here, stems from the General Systems Research
movement and the now closely allied fields of cybernetics and information
or communication theory.  The principal goal of the book is to bring to the
attention of a larger number of social scientists, particularly sociologists,
the wealth of principles, ideas, and insights that have already brought a
higher degree of scientific order and understanding to many areas of
biology, psychology, and some physical sciences to say nothing of the
applied areas of technology to which they are essential.

Sources of Information in the Social Sciences
.A
White, C.M.
.W
  Documentation in the social sciences is varied in form and content,
written for people in many walks of life, and fills several miles of shelving
in libraries that try to keep up with it.  Graduate students who qualify for
positions as professional librarians have to learn about this vast
preserve, and it is their need of guidance that explains the origin of this
book.
  The task of this book is to place in the reader's hands a sort of chart
and compass to use in finding his way around and learning how the system
works.
  For each subject, the treatment falls into two parts.  First a specialist,
sought out for his grasp of the literature, presents a bibliographical
review of basic monographic works for a collection of substantive material.
This review is followed by a list of reference works.  Informative
annotations are provided for all works except those adequately explained
by the title.  Specialized works are included, especially when they exemplify
types of sources important for reference purposes.  First priority goes to
works which may be looked upon as basic for a program of service to a
general clientele made up of scholars, students and the public at large.
If some stress falls on bibliographies, it is because they serve as controls
for opening doorways to even vaster information and to sources that are
more obscure.

Soviet Bibliography
.A
Levin, M.I.
.W
The first and most basic phase of research was the analysis of existing
bilbiographic publications.
The chronicles of the All-Union Book Reserve, VINITI abstract journals,
publications of subject information centers and main libraries, bulletins of
new publications, as well as the main current foreign bibliography on some
branches of knowledge were considered.
After comparative analysis valuable data were obtained in the completeness
of registration of literature and the efficiency of its reflection in
different publications; on the types of classificatory schemes and intermediate
instruments, on the quality of abstracts.
The merits and drawbacks of basic bibliographic publications were shown, and
recommendations for improving present bibliographic systems were suggested.

The Special Cataloguing
.A
Horner, J.
.W
  We feel, meanwhile, that many materials can be covered by general
or representative principles and rules.  The content of this book can
be viewed as of two types.  Firstly, the first and last chapters deal with
special materials in general, the former dealing with basic cataloguing
principles and problems, and the latter with the ultimate application
of such principles as manifested by the concept of the multi-media
catalogue and as aided by the computer.  Secondly, in between come
chapters dealing with individual categories of materials in detail.  Each
category receives two types of treatment.  First, the problems of both
approaches and description are examined as they apply to the particular
medium.  Second, the solutions put forward by representative codes are
summarized and commented upon.

Rational Selection of Primary Journals for a Biomedical Research Library:
The Use of Secondary Journal Citation
.A
Windsor, D.A.
.W
  After considering several different methods, it was concluded that primary
journals for coverage of a given field can be selected rationally on the basis 
of their citation frequencies in an appropriate secondary journal.  Results
obtained on the example used, "rehabilitation" as cited in Index Medicus during 
the years 1968-1971, were similar to those from five other fields, in that the 
number of journals required for each percent gain in literature coverage 
increased exponentially as the percentage of literature itself increased.  As 
a consequence, library coverage of any particular field can be specified as a 
function of its budgeting commitment, so that the maximum percent
coverage will be obtained for each dollar spent.

The Scientist Versus Machine Search Services: We are the Missing Link
.A
Maier, J.M.
.W
  To take advantage of computerized data bases to improve their services to
scientists without incurring prohibitive in-house expense, the librarians at 
the  Boulder Laboratories have campaigned to increase awareness and utilization 
via personal interviews, seminars, surveys, and critiques.  Data bases most 
studied were DDC, NASA, SIE, ASCA, and the University of Georgia.  The 
conclusions:  1) The scientist needs continuous  personal assistance by a 
librarian or information specialist in order to make effective use of data 
bases. 2) As local retailer, the librarian has an accordingly important role 
to play now and in the future, a role at present generally ignored.

Freud, Frug, and Feedback
.A
Shosid, N.J.
.W
  People ask one another, "Am I communicating?"  The question should be,
"What do you think I am communicating?"  The answer would be surprising.
Librarians are in the communications business.	Theories of nonverbal 
communication and role can be adapted to a library situation.  Applied, they
would provide a basis for improving librarian-library user communication.
Awareness of feedback is the key to this improvement.  Preliminary
investigations underway at the University of Southern California indicate
the reference encounter provides a investigative approach in which this
key can be utilized to enhance communication.

System Design, Evaluation, and Costing
.A
Herner, Saul
.W
  The word "system" as applied to information programs and activities is one
which is very foggily defined.  The purpose of this paper is to help clarify
the concept and discuss it in the context of the librarian's conventional
planning and administrative activities.  This is done through a narration
of the step-by-step procedures followed in the conceptualization and
design of an actual library and information program.  The steps involved
are the following:  definition of the purpose of the program, and financial
and administrative constraints on its design and operation, as envisaged by
management; a user study to determine needs and preferences of the presumed
audience of the program; analysis and definition of program performance
requirements; selection of methods and mechanisms for implementing
performance requirements; conceptualization and documentation of program
design; evaluation of design; modification and completion of design.
Two basic principles that are discussed and emphasized are the need to
define what the program should be doing and what it should not be doing,
and the need and means for determining real as opposed to apparent costs
in the design process.

Program Planning and Budget Theory
Improved Library Effectiveness by Use of
the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System
.A
Fazar, W.
.W
  Libraries have a great need to participate
more effectively in decisions that influence
their capacity to serve their users.  This paper
presents a means toward that end.  The relatively
new Planning-Programming-Budgeting System
is described in the context of its proven
utility in the Department of Defense and of
its growing utility in the civil sector of
organizations.  It describes the system's
background; its implementation in the federal
government; its spread into non-federal
sectors; and the system's methods, including
systems analysis, applied economics, and
quantitative reasoning.  The paper includes
illustrative example of results needed for
decision-making by managers, and basic guiding
principles for PPBS application.

  A determination of the needs of users is
absolutely essential to the management of an
Information Center.  Various techniques of
doing this (e.g., interview, diary, questionnaire,
etc.) are detailed along with their limitations.
Some specific user need studies
are described with their significant results.
Interactions between users and an information
system are described.  Finally, all of these
factors are considered in assessing the user
needs that might be used to properly manage
Information Centers.

The CAN/SDI Project
Th SDI Program of Canada's National Science Library
.A
Brown, J.E.
.W
  The National Science Library is not a
library in the conventional sense of the word
but rather an information transferral agency.
Its activities are designed to provide the
Canadian scientific and industrial communities
with direct and immediate access to the
publications and information required in their
day-to-day work.  Through co-operative measures
with both national and international information
agencies, the NSL serves as the focal
point of a national scientific and technical
information network.  The Library employs
a variety of mechanized techniques to
facilitate the storage, retrieval and
dissemination of information.  During the past three
years it has operated an SDI service using CT 
and ISI tapes.  In November 1968 this SDI
service, which had been limited to meeting
the needs of approximately 170 scientists in
the Ottawa area, was expanded to provide a
national SDI service.  The author describes
the evolution of these services from the local
to national level, outlines basic techniques,
describes the successes and failures of the
system and indicates future developments.

Current Awareness Publications An Evaluation
.A
Bloomfield, M.
.W
  Three types of current awareness publications
are defined in terms of their generation
and distribution characteristics.  These
types are the SDI type, the intermediate type
such as NASA's SCAN program, and the unselected
type such as the usual library accession
list.  A fourth type, the indexing and
abstracting journal is defined but not related
to the other three types.  The three current
awareness publications are shown to have a
relationship in terms of the number of
requests they can produce from a given set of
references or notices.  The SDI system will
produce about one request from ten notices;
the intermediate type about one request per
hundred notices; ad the unselected type,
one request per thousand notices.  Despite
the differences in the number of notices to
generate one request, the cost to produce one
request is about the same for the three types
of tools.  Also, the usage of these tools is
related to the amount of user time available
and a curve is presented based on various
assumptions to define this relationship.

Centralization vs. Decentralization:
A Location Analysis Approach for Librarians
.A
Raffel, J.
Shishko, R.
.W
  An application of location theory to
the question of centralized versus
decentralized library facilities for a
university, with relevance for special 
libraries is presented.  Locating university
libraries near classrooms, offices, and
dormitories requires a larger budget
than combining these libraries into a 
centralized facility.  Yet there is a cost
to the university community which does not 
appear in the university budget - a cost
in time, energy, and decreased use resulting
from locating the library a longer distance
from users.  The analysis provides models
for a single library, for two or more libraries,
or for decentralized facilities.

The Computerized File Management System
.A
Buginas, S.J.
Crow, N.B.
.W
  A file management system can provide a powerful search tool for a library
reference group.  The system described produces both current awareness and
retrospective searches from several diverse data bases.  The same query
language can be used to interrogate all data bases in either on-line or batch 
mode. Searches can be made for any word, word root, phrase, or number in any
part of any entry.  Citations selected by coordination of terms can be either
printed or used to custom-make new machine-readable files.  Costs are
reasonable; an average batch mode search requires 11 seconds of CDC 6600 time.

A Campus-Based Information Center

Carmon, J.L.

  Several features of the University of Georgia Information Dissemination 
Center, including current awareness, or SDI, and retrospective search services, 
the information specialists who provide the interface between the user and the
computer system, and an experimental network linking individual centers, are
discussed.  A survey which assessed the impact of the services on the 
information habits of the university users is also discussed.  Over 97% of the 
survey respondees indicated that the services had contributed to their 
professional activities.  Some users reported that the service had been
a method of bypassing library reference works; others indicated that the
service had brought them back into the  library and made them aware of 
information sources previously unknown to them.

Computer-Based Bibliographic Retrieval Services
.A
Park, M.K.
.W
  The Information Dissemination Center has emerged as a broker or retailer for
computer-based information retrieval services, interfacing with both the tape
suppliers and with users of the search services.  Five areas which impact the
center's interface with these two communities are discussed: the nature of the
data bases which are available for search; retrieval results and factors which 
affect them; the timeliness of services; costs and prices; and practical 
operational considerations related to library interests.  Comparison shopping 
between centers is advised as centers differ considerably
in the services which are offered,  the data bases which are available, the
experience of the information specialists who construct search profiles, 
pricing structures which are used, and the prices which are charged. 
Implications of the growing trend toward licensing and leasing information 
resources, especially magnetic tape services, are discussed briefly.

Journal Usage Survey Method and Application
.A
Langlois, D.C.
Von Schulz, J.V.
.W
  A survey of the R.E. Gibson Library's journal collection was conducted
to determine 1) which journal titles could be discontinued, 2) which journal
holdings could be moved to remote storage, and 3) which journal holdings
could be converted to microfilm.  Totals were maintained for three areas of
journal usage according to: 1) the number of times patrons used current 
issues, 2) the number of times the journal issues were reshelved by library 
staff, and 3) the number of times that journals were cited in articles by 
Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) authors.  The survey resulted in a 9.6% 
reduction in journal subscriptions which, in effect, added 7.5% additional 
shelf space in which to display journals.  Further studies of the
accumulated data are being made to determine which holdings will be sent to
a remote storage area which is under construction.  The survey data have been
and will continue to be consulted before any journals are converted to 
microfilm.

  Computer output in microfilm or microfiche form (COM) rather than
computer printout and conventional forms of reproduction is one possible way
special librarians can reduce their costs, space needs, and time lags.  COM is
described among with the equipment needed, where to find it, and experiences of 
one special library.  Possible savins are compared with additional reading and
special reproduction equipment required as well as the advantages and 
disadvantages to be weighed in deciding on COM.

A Comparison of Manual and Machine Literature Searches
.A
Bivans, M.M.
.W
  The NOAA/ERL library in Boulder, Colorado, performed a sample of six
literature searches in an effort to gain management support for
searches prior to launching research projects.  It was found that manual
searches are very time consuming  and, in our opinion, can better be
done by persons with subject background. The machine searches furnished a 
higher percentage of unrelated materials. However, little staff time is required
to obtain them.  Lacking qualified persons to do literature searches,
either in the library or in the research groups, greater use should be made of 
the available computerized searches.

How Do Scientists Meet Their Information Needs?
.A
Chen, C.
.W
  A survey of the information use patterns and communication practices
of academic physicists in the  greater Boston area reveals that academic 
physicists rely heavily on formal and informal sources of information.  Their
use of formal publications concentrates on a small number of journal titles.  
Time and location factors play an important role
in their information seeking and gathering. A considerable number of the
physicists surveyed do not seek librarians' help when searching for
information in the library.  Although libraries have been considered largely as
storehouses of materials and librarians organizers of these materials, more 
active roles for librarians are possible.

Cost Comparison of Manual and On-Line Computerized
Literature Searching
.A
Elman, S.A.
.W
  Cost and searching time comparisons are made between manual and on-line
literature searches.  The formula     Ctotal = (T X Csum) + P
is presented which captures all on-line cost factors.  A minimum cost of $1.00
per minute of on-line searching is derived.  Average searching time for
manual searching is 22 hours at a total cost of $250; for on-line it is 45 
minutes at total cost of $47.00.  It is pointed out that most reported low-on 
line search costs fail to account for all cost factors.
Figures are those prevailing at the time of writing.

User Criteria for Selection of Commercial
On-Line Computer-Based  Bibliographic Services
.A
Marshall, D.B.
.W
  Many interrelating factors with examples have been cited as criteria for 
selection and proper use of commercial on-line computer-based bibliographic 
services in an industrial environment.  These complex factors have been analyzed
under the needs of the users, the selection of hardware, the selection of mode 
of transmission, the selection of vendors and systems, the selection of data 
bases, the development of productive search strategy and the considerations of
measures to test it, the attitude of management, and the interaction of the
user with the system.  In the author's experience exhaustive and comprehensive
searches were minimally requested, thus posing questions for determining 
measures of evaluation.

Criteria for Evaluation and Selection of Data
Bases and Data Base Services

  Libraries, as potential users of bibliographic data base services, will need 
to evaluate not only the contents of the many data bases available but the
different services provided by various processing centers.  Criteria for 
selection of data bases and data base services such as searching features, 
logical capacity, document delivery, output format and medium, and costs are 
examined.

On-Line Reference Retrieval in a Public Library
.A
Summit, R.K.
Firschein, O.
.W
  There are many useful computer-readable data bases that are accessible
only to major governmental units, universities, or industrial organizations.
An experiment is described in which the public library is used as a "linking 
agent" between the public and such data bases. Retrieval terminals have been 
placed  in four public libraries in Northern California to provide access to 
sixteen different data bases.  The first year of this two-year experiment is 
described, and some of the technical, organizational, and economic aspects of 
the study are reviewed. Rapid acceptance of the system during this initial 
no-cost period has been achieved and  useful evaluative data have been obtained.

Standards for Library Service: An International Survey
.A
Withers, F.N.
.W
  In recent years, it has become recognized that a country's
documentation and library services, indispensable for all forms of
economic, social and cultural development, should be considered
as one co-ordinated information system and accordingly included
in any national development plans.  However, planning can only be
carried out if the necessary statistical data and other information
are available.  Unesco therefore concluded a contract in 1968 with
the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) for a
survey of standards for library services currently recommended for
libraries of all types in different countries.  The work was entrusted
to F.N. Withers, a research fellow at the Polytechnic of North
London School of Librarianship (United Kingdom).

State Library Policy
.A
Stangelo, D.
.W
  State library policy is the focus of this study.  The approach to policy
is framed in the broadest possible terms currently permitted by empirical
research in the examination of governmental policy formation.  A major
purpose of the study is to analyze state library policy in relationship to
the environment which provides the backdrop for its formation and
maintenance.  The authors see this ambitious effort as a pioneering
thrust in library research and not as the final work on library policy.

Statistical Bibliography in Relation to the Growth of Modern Civilization
.A
Hulme, E.W.
.W
  The following pages form the concluding portion of four lectures
delivered by me in the University of Cambridge as Sandars Reader
in Bibliography, 1921.
  As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classes
of the community, I have decided to print them separately, though
the underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity in
book classification as a preliminary to co-operative action in
library administration and bibliography.
  Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classification
carried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformity
in the extension and definition of its classes.  Add to this a
chronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of
classification acquires a new value; for it presents for each period
a bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the
activities of the human mind.
  My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical
application to library work and the compilation of subject
bibliographies.  Here statistical bibliography is considered in
relation to the growth of modern civilization.
  Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography ends
with the presentation of the figures compiled.  Their final
interpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary
qualifications.  I am, therefore, conscious that in attempting to
furnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factors
which are associated with the growth of modern civilization, I have
outstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety.  On this count
I offer no defense.

Statistical Methods for the Study of Lexicon
.A
Frumkina, R.M.
.W
This book studies the qualitative relations between text and dictionary
compilation.
Chapter I considers general questions related to the compilation and use of
frequency vocabulary; a new Zipf's Law.
Chapter III considers various ways of describing the statistical properties
of a text and its lexicon, and presents the results of the author's research
on the statistic structure of Pushkin's lexicon.
Chapter IV considers methods for comparing the vocabulary of texts.
A new method for comparing word lists is suggested, which is then used for
comparing word lists from the different geures in Pushkin's works.

Statistics and Semantics
.A
Moskovich, V.A.
.W
This monograph is one of the few works in which the possibility of studying
semantics using statistical methods is proven with actual research.
The semantic field of words denoting color (in English, French, Russian and
Ukranian) was chosen as a representative semantic object.
The applied aspects of this work are particularly important: the application
of those methods tested by the authors for solving problems of automatic
information processing, as well as in language translation and instruction.

A Strategy for Public Library Change

        The fate of the American institutional phenomenon, the public
library, is in question.  Its position has never been truly secure
in terms of general use or public support except in the large cities
until recent years, and for a few short periods of marked progress
countrywide.

Structural Models:  an introduction to the theory of directed graphs
.A
Harary, F.
.W
  The purpose of this book is to present an introduction to a body of
mathematics concerned with the abstract notion of "structure."  Its
preparation has been motivated by the belief that knowledge of the
mathematics of abstract structures will be of value to investigators
interested in various kinds of empirical structures.  The mathematics
with which we are concerned is known as the theory of directed graphs,
or more briefly as digraph theory.  It deals with abstract configurations
called digraphs, which consist of "points" and "directed lines."  When
these terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematical
models of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflect
structural properties of the empirical world.  Since the same mathematical
terms can be given a variety of empirical meanings, digraph theory has
applicability to many different fields of investigation.

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions

Kuhn, T.S.
.W
  The essay that follows is the first full published report on a
project originally conceived almost fifteen years ago.  At that
time I was a graduate student in theoretical physics already
within sight of the end of my dissertation.  A fortunate involvement
with an experimental college course treating physical
science for the non-scientist provided my first exposure to
out-of-date scientific theory and practice radically undermined
some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and
the reasons for its special success.
  Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partly
from scientific training itself and partly from a long-standing
avocational interest in the philosophy of science.  Somehow,
whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility,
those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study
displayed.  Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions
of science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore
seemed thoroughly worth pursuing.  The result was a drastic
shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of
science and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward
historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that
had initially led me to history.  Except for a few articles, this
essay is the first of my published works in which these early
concerns are dominant.  In some part it is an attempt to explain
to myself and to friends how I happened to be drawn from
science to its history in the first place.

Structure of Discourse
.A
Sevbo, I.P.
.W
This monograph studies the external links between the sentences within a
paragraph.
Two basic problems are solved:	a formal apparatus for deriving simplified
versions of the text's phrases is devised and the regularities in the
formation of word strings are determined.
Also considers future developments in the field of automatized abstracting.

Studies in Ethnomethodology
.A
Garfinkel, H.
.W
  In doing sociology, lay and professional, every reference to the
"real world," even where the reference is to physical or biological
events, is a reference to the organized activities of everyday life.
Thereby, in contrast to certain versions of Durkheim that teach that
the objective reality of social facts is sociology's fundamental
principle, the lesson is taken instead, and used as study policy, that
the objective reality of social facts as an ongoing accomplishment
of the concerted activities of daily life, with the ordinary, artful
ways of that accomplishment being by members known, used, ad
taken for granted, is, for members doing sociology, a fundamental
phenomenon.  Because, and in the ways it is practical sociology's
fundamental phenomenon, it is the prevailing topic for ethno-methodological
study.  Ethnomethodological studies analyze everyday activities as
members' methods for making those same activities visibly-rational- 
and-reportable-for-all-practical-purposes, i.e., "accountable," as
organizations of commonplace everyday activities.  The reflexivity
of that phenomenon is a singular feature of practical actions, of
practical circumstances, of common sense knowledge of social structures,
and of practical sociological reasoning.  By permitting us to locate
and examine their occurrence the reflexivity of that phenomenon establishes
their study.

A Study of the Characteristics, Cost and Magnitude of
Interlibrary Loans in Academic Libraries
.A
Palmour, V.E.

  The investigation of interlibrary loans among academic libraries was
initiated by the Interlibrary Loan Study Committee of the Association of
Research Libraries.  It was seen as a fundamental first step toward the
solution of current problems and the exploration of the means to improve
interlibrary loan services nationally.  This report provides solid
information that is basic to any future planning at the national level.

A Study of General Categories Applicable
to Classification and Coding in Documentation
.A
Grolier, E.D.
.W
  The rapid development of information retrieval methods since
the last war - together with the development of systems using
mechanical or electromechanical means (punched cards) for such
purposes followed later by electronic retrieval (computers) - have
led to transformations in the structure of classification or coding
systems for books and documents.  Generally speaking, document
specialists have tended to elaborate a large number of different
codes, usually totally unrelated to each other, each conceived
to meet the special documentation requirements of a particular
organization.  This is farther than ever - at least to all
appearances - from the original intention of 1895 of the founders
of the Institut International de Bibliographie (now known as the
Federation Internationale de Documentation), i.e., the standardization
of classification methods.

Subject Analysis: Computer Implications of Rigorous Definator
.A
Harris, J.L.
.W
   Subject analysis for information retrieval is an area
which always seems deceptively simple to those without
previous background in it, however extensive their background
in specific subject disciplines may be.  The basic
requirement seems easy enough: to structure the statement
of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, and
retrieved from, an ordered file.
   While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complex
terms or even single words, it always becomes
evident that single words are often insufficient to express a
subject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex.
To express such subjects requires either that their constituent
concepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined,
or that only one part of the subject be shown.
   The former solution requires that the indexer perform
the necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate the
constituents for the searcher to reassemble.  The latter
forces the seeker of information to sort through many items
to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, and
ma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of the
concept an entry should be made.

The Subject Approach to Information
.A
Foskett, A.C.
.W
  The first edition of this book, published in 1969, was prompted
by changes in the Library Association syllabus which for the first time
enables lecturers to treat classification and subject cataloging as
different aspects of the same topic.  These changes coincided with the
publication of the results of the Cranfield project, which showed
clearly that all indexing languages are basically the same.  However,
although it was possible to teach these new approaches, there was no
one textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that I felt
was needed.  The first edition was intended to fill this gap, and its
reception, both in Britain and abroad, showed that it did indeed fulfill a
real need.  It met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and -
more importantly - from students, particularly in the United States,
where British textbooks on classification had previously been regarded
with something akin to suspicion.  (As the Dean of one American
library school is alleged to have remarked, 'What theory of classification?')

Subject Catalogues
Heading and Structure
.A
Coates, E.J.
.W
  In 1955 the Publications Committee of the Library Association
approached my chief, Mr. A.J. Wells, with a request that he should
write a book on subject cataloguing.  At the time, Mr. Wells was
preoccupied with the inauguration of the British National Bibliography
Card Service, and he made the suggestion, which was agreed by the
Committee, that I should undertake the task.  The result is scarcely an
adequate substitute for the book which Mr. Wells would have written.
Nevertheless, he has had a major part in shaping my views on subject
cataloguing, and in this sense the present book stems back to him,
though he might not subscribe to all the views now put forward.

Subject Headings: A Practical Guide
.A
Haykin, D.J.
.W
    The alphabetical subject catalog, either self-contained, or as the subject
element in the dictionary catalog, is a later development that the systematic,
or classed, catalog (Realkatalog, catalogue raisonne).  In this country it
has almost completely displaced the latter.  The principal classed catalogs   
now remaining are those of the Engineering Societies Library in New York,
the John Crerar Library in Chicago, and the Science and Technology Department
of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.  There are, nevertheless, many things
to commend the classed catalog.  Rudolf Kaiser sums up the argument between
the classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs both
and explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabetical
catalog is concerned.  However, his conclusion misses the mark, since, for
one not completely the master of the system of classification, there is no
approach to the classed catalog save through an index, yet the index is not
in fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library's
collections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross-referenced.

Survey of Commercially Available Computer-Readable Bibliographic Data Bases
.A
Schneider, John H.
Gechman, Marvin
Furth, Stephen E.
.W
   This document contains the results of a survey of 94 US organizations, 
and 36 organizations in other countries that were thought to prepare 
machine-readable data bases.. Of those surveyed, 55 organizations (40 in U.S., 
15 in other countries) provided completed camera-ready forms describing
bibliographic information about published literature..
   The following types of data were requested for each data base:  Name, 
frequency of issue, and time span covered by the data base; Name of 
organizations and individuals who can provide information on the data base;
Subject matter and scope of data on the tape; Source of information in the

Survey of the Interlibrary Loan Operation of the National Library of Medicine
.A
Kurth, W. H.
.W
    This paper reports a survey of the interlibrary loan operations at the
National Library of Medicine.
    The operations discussed here represent a significant departure from
conventional interlibrary loan routines.  The substance of the present report
pertains to the handling of interlibrary loans through the instrumentality of
photoduplication.  This concept - providing photoduplicates of desired
materials in lieu of loaning the originals - stems from thinking enunciated by
Atherton Seidell, a member of the Friends of the Army Medical Library who
pioneered in the development of photoduplication services.

Switching and Finite Automata Theory
.A
Kohavi, Z.
.W
  The subject of switching and finite automata theory needs no introduction.
It has become a part of every computer science and electrical
engineering curriculum, and rightly so.  It provides techniques useful
in a wide variety of applications and helps develop a way of thinking that
leads to understanding of the structure, behavior, and limitations and
capabilities of logical machines.  In this book I have tried to cover the
whole subject, starting with introductory material and leading to the
more advanced topics, assuming a minimal technical background on the
part of the reader.  I did not attempt to provide detailed techniques
for the design of specific circuits, but rather to formulate methods and to
develop algorithms that can be applied to a broad class of problems.
For once such general principles are understood, the relevance of specific
procedures and their applicability to given problems are a matter of
engineering decisions.

Syntactic Structures
.A
Chomsky, N.
.W
  This study deals with syntactic structure both in the broad sense
(as opposed to semantics) and the narrow sense (as opposed to
phonemics and morphology).  It forms part of an attempt to construct
a formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to
explore the foundations of such a theory.  The search for rigorous
formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than
mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-established
methods of linguistic analysis.  Precisely constructed models
for linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative
and positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precise
but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can
often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently,
gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.  More positively,
a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many
problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed.
Obscure and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurd
conclusions nor provide new and correct ones, and hence they fail to
be useful in two important respects.

Systematic Analysis of University Libraries
.A
Raffel, J.A.
.W
  As the administrators and librarians on every campus know, limited
resources force hard choices among many desirable schemes for
expanding and improving library facilities.  What percentage of new
books should be acquired, how much service should be provided,
how luxurious or austere should new library buildings be?

Systems Analysis of a University Library; final report on a research project
.A
Buckland, M.K.
.W
    The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly 
stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic 
libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but although
changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective 
information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university.
The report of the UGC Committee on Librarys (the Parry Report (267)), which,
in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into
all aspects of academic library provision.

Systems Approach
.A
Churchman, C.W.
.W
  There is no question that in our age there is a good deal of
turmoil about the manner in which our society is run.  Probably at
no prior point in the history of man has there been so much discussion
about the rights and wrongs of the policy makers, whether they be the
politicians in Albany or Sacramento, in Washington, Paris, or Moscow,
the managers of far-flung industrial firms, or the people who run
educational institutions.  In all cases the citizen feels a perfect
right to have his say about the way in which the managers manage.
  Not only has the citizen become far more vocal, but he has also
in many instances begun to suspect that the people who make
the major decisions that affect our lives don't know what they
are doing.  They don't know what they are doing simply because
they have no adequate basis to judge the effects of their decisions.

Targets for Research in Library Education
.A
Borko, H.
.W
  Few librarians and library educators who criticize research relating
to their fields realize in 1972 how far research has progressed during
the last decade and a half.  The criticism usually relates to the
recognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact-
finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in
the research activities of others rather than to conduct their own.  One
can add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a
week on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on
original research or the writing of proposals, which either are not
adequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for.  If
the librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionally
criticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited
interest to the reviewer.  Or he finds that while many praise his work there
are no funds, possibilities, or opportunities to translate his conclusions
into action.

Technical Libraries; users and their demands:
a classification of user groups and user demands
in technical libraries
.A
Slater, M.
.W
        This study of the habits of customers of technical
libraries and information departments had three main aims.
1. Determination of user demands:  to discover what items of
information or documents customers seek, why they seek
them and how they obtain them.
2. Classification of user groups and their demands:  to test a
hypothesis; that it is possible to classify customers into
meaningful user groups possessing recognizable common
features and characteristic behavior patterns, and to
classify group needs.
3. Estimation of the significance of the above for librarians:
to measure the demand on librarians and libraries, in
terms of expenditure of their time and skill, and use of
stock made by different user groups.

Techniques of Information Retrieval
.A
Vickery, B.C.
.W
  Information retrieval is now an accepted part of the new discipline of
information science and technology, and its principles are taught not only in
librarianship and documentation, but also in courses of systems design.
There are half a dozen useful texts available, each with a special emphasis
arising from the varied backgrounds and interests of the authors.

Technology; economic growth and public policy
.A
Nelson, R.R.
.W
  This book explores the relations among research, development, innovation,
and economic growth; considers the manner in which the economy adapts to
technical change and the problems encountered in the processes of adaption;
and recommends several policy changes designed to encourage technological
change consistent with other public policy objectives.  Since they address
policy makers as well as scholars, the authors have tried to avoid scholarly
jargon without sacrificing scholarly rigor.

Technology, Information, and Organization Information Transfer in Industrial
R and D
.A
Rosenbloom, R. S.
.W
   This is an empirical study of information transfer in the R&D operations of
large industrial corporations.. Its basis is a body of survey data collected 
from 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporations
and from 1200 members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers.. The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful
technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of 
colleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional
approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is 
considered in relation to the purposes of technical work..
   While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of this
sort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will
vary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report explores
the association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational,
and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of 
information.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, those
variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the
information was applied..
   The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions,
one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body
of systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operational
objectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informal
sources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and more
distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on 
"professional" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge..
   In conclusion, the report discusses the effects which management may have,
within an organization, on the process of information transfer, and the need 
for managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay in
this process of personal values, task requisites, and the structure of formal 
and social groups.. Firms need to establish two-way communication about needs 
and  possibilities; by so doing they may enhance the effectiveness with which
advances in knowledge are translated into innovations in technology meeting the
needs of society..

Technology and Information Transfer
.A
Rosenbloom, R.S.
.W
  In 1963 research at the Harvard Business School was initiated
by Richard Rosenbloom and Frank Wolek to describe the process
by which technical information is communicated and used.  National
and corporate attention had been increasingly drawn to the
interaction between scientific and technological advance and social
change.  This problem was considered to be of considerable
practical importance at that time, as it still is.  This volume
is a product of that effort.  The research focuses upon the flow of
technical information across organizational lines in the research and
development operations of large industrial corporations.  The basis of
the work is a body of survey data collected from 2,000 engineers and
scientists in 13 establishments of 4 corporations, and from 1,200
members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful
technical information from sources outside their immediate circle
of colleagues.  The analysis is descriptive in character, following a
functional approach in which the use of various means of information
transfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technical
work.

    The use of telefacsimile systems to provide rapid transfer of 
information has great appeal.  Because of a growing interest in the
possible applicability of this technology to libraries, the Council
on Library Resources provided a grant to the Institute of Library
Research to conduct an experiment using telefacsimile equipment in a
working library situation.  The study was designed to explore the
feasibility of telefacsimile for present interlibrary use.  It provides
information on the performance, cost, and utility of telefacsimile
systems for libraries.

Probability Theory
.A
Ventsel, E.W.
.W
This book is a textbook intended for those generally familiar with mathematics
who are interested in the technical applications of probability theory, in
particular of the theory of shooting [?].
The book will also be of interest to engineers in other fields who find it
necessary to use the theory of probability.
The book is distinguished by the major attention it pays to new branches of
probability theory which are important in application (for example, the
theory of probabilistic processes, information theory, the theory of mass
servicing, etc.).

  The Terminology of Documentation is intended to help standardize basic
terminology in the rapidly developing field of documentation and thus to
foster international co-operation. It should also be useful as a reference 
work for organizations and individuals working in the fields of documentation,
libraries and information processing, to translators and to students in these
fields.

  Before work can begin on the construction of a thesaurus, a study
should be made of the information retrieval system it is intended to
serve.  Only when the requirements of the system are known can
consideration be given to the type of thesaurus which would be most
effective in a specific situation.

The Thesaurus in Retrieval
.A
Gilchrist, A.
.W
  This book does not purport to provide all the answers to the problem (such a
claim would be rightly suspect) but to collect together problems and experiences
pertaining to the technique.  Though three of the case studies in Chapter 8 are
from outside the United Kingdom, there is an inevitable bias towards British
experience and English-language thesauri.  It is hoped that people outside
this country will find the book useful, but there is little mention of, for
example, the language problem.  The way in which compound terms are treated
clearly depends on whether one is indexing in German, French or English, and
each language exhibits a different morphology.

Computer-Based Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) Service for
Faculty Using Library of Congress Machine-Readable Catalog (MARC) Records
.A
Studer, William Joseph
.W
   From November 1966 through June 1968 the Library of Congress conducted a
pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog
cards in machine-readable form.. The MARC records provided a search data base 
for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with
biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified
fields of interest..
   Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in
participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants
could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of 
faculty members in each department or school:  anthropology-l, business-10, 
economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3..
   An "interest" statement from each faculty member was translated into both
Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading 
terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, 
parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF
becomes six terms:  U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting
"interest profiles" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with
subject headings and class numbers..
   The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC
records.. Each profile was assigned a "cutoff weight" or "hit level" of 6.. 
Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the
sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than 
the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a
particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a 
hit would occur on any matching number..
   Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program
Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number 
(accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current
records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in
the profiles and recorded the card numbers for "hits"; Program Print compared
these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies 
of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty 
member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used
for making recommendations to the library..
   Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file
mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, 
whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's
second or third heading..
   The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting
relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73
percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the
faculty.  The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, 
regular  notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to
their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they
otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all
but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a 
convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the
amount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI 
service continued..

Synthesis, Identification and Control of Distributed Parameter Systems
.A
Jain, Anil Kumar
.W
   Many synthesis, identification and control problems that arise in 
distributed parameter systems are studied.. Two major approaches, viz., the 
frequency domain approach and the time domain approach, are considered.. The 
techniques developed overcome many difficulties that are associated with
optimization problems in distributed parameter systems..
   In the frequency domain, distributed systems described by the general
(linear) telegrapher's equations are considered, over a finite band of
frequencies.. An electric network, equivalent to these systems, is developed..
Many optimization problems, that are of practical interest, are formulated
in terms of this new equivalent network.. Some of the basic principles of
lumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems..  
Many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation are 
discussed..
   In the time domain, a method of characteristics is developed as a method of
solution for optimization problems.. First and second order hyperbolic systems
are considered.. Imbedding and Gradient techniques developed along the 
characteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages.. It is
shown that solving for Green's function (and associated eigenvalue problem) is
not required..
   It is hoped that the methods developed here will lead efficiently to actual
realization of optimal distributed systems..

Least Cost Decision Rules for the Selection of Library Materials for
Compact Storage
.A
Lister, Winston Charles
.W
   For the last several decades library collections have been growing at
exponential rates with no relief evident in the future..
   To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections,
many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for
little-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage
system are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the 
criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study
demonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage 
quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the
small shelving costs associated with stored materials..
   Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the
other utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared..
For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical
age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the 
fraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the
circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average 
geometric pattern of obsolescence..
   The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is
utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision
variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage 
rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that
a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being 
used.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which 
the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, 
although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite 
distribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon 
the circulation activities of the individual libraries..
   An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected
from three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters
extracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules
and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from
storage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the
collection must be stored..
   Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the
latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation 
where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit 
relocation cost..
   Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values
show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively 
insignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the 
capacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; 
and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost
differential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather
subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a
potentially large influence on the decision rules..

Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library
Systems
.A
O'Neill, Edward True
.W
   Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research..
Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major
responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most
universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized
libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This
use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally,
resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this 
division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to 
examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the 
scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. 
These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library 
systems..
   Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually
estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are
developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its
advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made
relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can
be defined in comparable terms.. A "discipline wheel" is proposed which can
serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines..
This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and
also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines..
   One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study
of journal productivity is the concept of "scattering" of articles or "title
dispersion".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has 
resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford
distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various
sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the
Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered..
   The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and 
evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in 
determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding
additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and
building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the
applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity
functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as
a function of the number of subscriptions it receives..
   The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which
the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was 
collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. 
dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete
records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained..
The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally
satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific
disciplines is measured as is the similarity
between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also
measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's
holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed 
and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions..
   This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts
as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between 
disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis
for the design and evaluation of complete library systems..

Utility of Automatic Classification Systems for Information Storage and
Retrieval
.A
Litofsky, Barry
.W
   Large-scale, on-line information storage and retrieval systems pose numerous 
problems above those encountered by smaller systems.. The more critical of
these problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability, 
storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problems 
is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and 
advantages..
   The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori 
automatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility is 
demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 document 
descriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by
establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and
applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies..
By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual and 
one automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the 
indexing method used..
   It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied,
one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. In
addition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least
as good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, as
the a priori, manual classification system currently in use with the 
aforementioned file..
   The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying a 
file of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included
as an appendix to this dissertation..

Time-Lag in Cataloging
.A
Pope, S.E.
.W
        Any who have the arduous task of assisting a student
through that ultimate of academic exercises, the preparation
and defense of a dissertation, are likely to define happiness
as a good book written by an advisee.  This book is a cause
of joy.  The author expended much more effort than is usually
the case to gain even the smallest detail, because the subject
matter is strangely intractable, hedged round with perplexities
and not a few vested interests.  Letters and reports get locked
away where they may not be seen except by the most persistent
investigator and one who somehow meets criteria that no one else
can claim.  In the end, the author deserves the praise and the
advisor is well rewarded with the inner satisfaction that comes
from participation in an important investigation finished as an
influential and well-written book.

Title Derivative Indexing Techniques; a comparative study
.A
Feinberg, H.
.W
	The increasing volume of published literature continues to present
problems in relation to information handling and information representation.
As the magnitude and complexity of the available information has continued
to increase, investigators have examined means of reducing the costly and
time-consuming processes involved when human beings assign index terms to
documents.  Recognition of the general inadequacy of present indexing, and
concern over time and cost factors in index preparation have prompted
experimentation in the development and application of machines to assist
in the indexing process.  As a result, use of suitable mechanized or partly
mechanized procedures to replace or complement the manual indexing process
has become more widespread.  Machine indexing is a process whereby mechanized
or automatic selection or generation of indexing terms is accomplished.  The
present study investigates one aspect of automatic computer-based indexing,
the permuted title index.

Towards Information Retrieval
.A
Fairthorne, R.A.
.W
  The selection of papers published here explores activities in which
indefinite neglect of either aspect, the conceptual or the mechanical,
will lead to practical and theoretical disaster.  They centre on the
recovery of records according to their subject matter.
  Since libraries began, librarians have evolved, studied, and taught
procedures for indexing and classifying.  These allow some delegation
from subject specialists who understand the subject matter, to
library staff who can recognize the ways in which specialists talk
about it.  The procedures consider mostly only the interpretation
of texts, not the text itself as an object with recognizable marks
subject to the laws of physics and the principles of engineering.
They assume the problems of topic identification solved, and the
methods for recovering physical texts as independent of the methods
for describing the interpretations of texts.

Training for Library Service:  a report prepared for the
Carnegie Corporation of New York
.A
Williamson, C.C.
.W
    The primary purpose in preparing the following report was
to present existing conditions in this country with respect to
training for library work in such a way that the educator and
the layman interested in educational problems might be able to form
a true conception of the steps that should be taken to improve this
phase of the library situation.
    The author has been obliged to limit the scope of his study to the
so-called professional schools.  He has treated only incidentally training
classes, summer schools, and other types of library training agency.  An
effort has been made to discover and to point out the strong and weak
points in the organization of these library schools and in the training
which they offer.  Many of the defects disclosed could be remedied by
the schools themselves; others are due to extreme poverty and can be
remedied only by increased income.

University Library Administration
.A
Rogers, R.D.
.W
  A university library is both a collegiate library and a research library.
It is collegiate in its provision of books and other documentary records
to support the students' program of instruction and to encourage the
habit of reading and the use of libraries.  As does the college library,
the university library must also provide materials for use by the faculty
members in the preparation of their courses of instruction and by the staff
of the institution in the performance of their administrative responsibilities.
However, the university library differs from the college library in offering
a wider range of undergraduate programs, offering graduate instruction beyond
the Master's level, and usually offering advanced professional programs in a
number of fields.

Undergraduate Library
.A
Hoadley, I.B.
.W
    The development of the separately housed undergraduate library on the
modern university campus is a recent innovation - so recent, in fact, that
in September, 1965, there were only six such libraries in the United States.
The interest in effective undergraduate education which led to the creation
of these libraries, however, is not of such recent origin.  As early as 1608,
when Thomas James was appointed to Bodley's Library, "he proposed the
establishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student.  But
Sir Thomas Bodley was opposed."  So it is to Harvard that we turn for an 
example of the protracted concern for the undergraduate's plight.
    Despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers, most universities and
their libraries were relatively small until this century.  More important,
they were largely undergraduate institutions.  The great expansion of
graduate education is a twentieth-century phenomenon.  The problems of the
undergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded by
the striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasis
on the acquisition of materials suitable for research.
    The large university collections became increasingly difficult for the
undergraduate to use.  When he had to select his books from the card catalog
and obtain them through paging in a closed-stack system, he might well
abandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out,
missing, or at the bindery - and which was suitable for his purposes.  The
university library was also difficult to use because it was crowded - study
conditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle the
volume of work.

Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man
.A
Mcluhan, M
.W
  With the advent of individual detribalized man, a new
education was needed.  Plato devised such a new program for 
literate men.  It was based on the Ideas.  With the
phonetic alphabet, classified wisdom took over from the
operational wisdom of Homer and Hesiod and the tribal 
encyclopedia.  Education by classified data has been the
Western program ever since.
  Now, however, in the electronic age, data classification
yields to pattern recognition, the key phrase at IBM.  When
data moves instantly, classification is too fragmentary.  In
order to cope with data at electric speed in typical situations
of "information overload," men resort to the study of configurations,
like the sailor in Edgar Allan Poe's Maelstrom.
  "The medium is the message" means, in terms of the electronic
age, that a totally new environment has been created.  The "content"
of this new environment is the old mechanized environment of
the industrial age.

Understanding Media:  the extensions of man
.A
Winograd, T.
.W
  When it was decided that Cognitive Psychology would not specify
size limits for articles, and that we would publish relevant papers in
artificial intelligence, we hardly anticipated devoting an entire issue to a
single piece of work.  However, Winograd's "Program for Understanding
Natural Language" seems sufficiently general and important in its
implications to warrant the experiment.  Some readers will find sufficient
the first two sections, which present, respectively, an overview of the
system and what it does, and a first-rate evaluation of research in artificial
intelligence on natural language processing, semantics, and theorem proving.
Others will want to explore in detail the structure of the syntactic
component, the treatment of semantics, and the programming language
for specifying theories of problem solving.  Each of these contributions
is significant in its own right.  Together they form a unique, integrated
system capable of parsing, interpreting, and acting upon the information
contained in complex natural language discourse.

Understanding Scientific Literatures:
A Bibliographic Approach
.A
Donohue, J.C.
.W
  As the author states, the methods he describes treat the growth
of a scientific literature as a social phenomenon in its own
right, not as a material byproduct of the knowledge and
concepts of the science written about.  Management of the
literature of physics, say, does not first demand the study of
physics, but of physicists.  Management of the literature of
information sciences demands first the study of information
scientists.

Purpose of this paper.  The purpose of this preliminary study is to attempt  
to discover how far it succeeds at present and how far and by what methods
it may continue to succeed or be made to succeed in the future.  One person
(or two, for Brian Vickery is tackling the problem from the point of view
of scientific and technological users) with however many helpful consultants
can only hope to isolate some of the problems and to indicate some of the
possible solutions.  This, it is hoped, may prepare the ground and stimulate
the critical and creative efforts of others towards fruitful developments.

The Universal Decimal Classification and Technical Information Indexing
.A
Vickery, B.C.
.W
    This study of the UDC sets out from the assumption that both general and
special documentation services can make use of a general classification.  On the
other hand, it assumes that the criticisms of the UDC - the preference of
some documentalists for alternative special schemes - imply that the UDC
does not adequately provide the facilities currently needed.  In examining these
criticisms and some special schemes an effort is made here to elucidate those
features of the UDC which prevent it from being more widely used and then to
suggest how the UDC might be developed to provide the facilities needed.

  A new step towards international co-operation
in scientific and technical information. 
  The agencies specializing in documentation of documentation (i.e., handling
the literature on scientific and technical information) are in turn having
problems with the growth of information.  The number of their centres has 
been growing during the last few years - often several in a country and all
with activities that are often very similar; scanning and abstracting of
documents from the same sources, indexing jobs that may differ only in
practical details, more or less identical end-products (descriptive
bibliographies, abstracting bulletins, indexes, selective distribution
programmes, card-indexes, and so on).

The Ranking of Biomedical Periodicals from the Indian Scientist's Point
of View
.A
Sengupta, I. N.
.W
   The output of scientific literature has been increasing exponentially since
the second quarter of this century.. New journals in specialized branches of 
science keep appearing and established periodicals either multiply the number of 
volumes per year or split into different titles covering narrower subject 
areas in order to cope with the flow of communications received for 
publication.. The limited resources or libraries, particularly in the 
developing countries, do not permit them to increase library space or budget at
a rate commensurate with this rise in publication.. Consequently research 
libraries in such countries as India must be highly selective in their
acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests
of the institution they serve, they urgently need dependable data on the ranking 
of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective 
countries.. In this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field
of the biomedical sciences, from the point of view of the Indian scientist..
This method may also be followed in the libraries of other developing countries 
by changing the citing journals according to their country's needs..

  The ILFA Committee on Cataloguing has been at work since 1954 to establish
international standards for cataloguing and bibliographical records, and
was responsible for the International conference on Cataloguing Principles,
Paris, 1961, and the International Medical of Cataloguing Experts, 
Copenhagen, 1969.  A new impetus to its work has been given in 1971
with the establishment of its permanent Cataoguing Secretariat whose 
function were to act as a co-ordinating centre, to promote cataloguing
projects and to disseminate information.

ISDS and the Functions and Activities of National Centres
.A
Koster, C.J.
.W
  An International Serials Data System (ISDS) is being established within
the framework of UNISIST - a world science information system.  Each serial 
will be assigned an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).  An 
International Centre for the Registration of Serial Publications, with
headquarters in Paris, will be responsible for specifying the characteristics
of the world register and maintaining an up-to-date file of serial titles.
National and regional centres will supply input on new titles to the register
and act as a link between the international centre and individual users.

An Unhurried View of Copyright
.A
Kaplan, B.
.W
  Copyright protection became necessary with the invention
of the printing press and had its early beginnings in the
British censorship laws.  The fortunes of the law of copyright
have always been closely connected with freedom of expression,
on the one hand, and with technological improvements
in means of dissemination, on the other.  Successive ages have
drawn different balances among the interest of the writer in
the control and exploitation of his intellectual property, the
related interest of the publisher, and the competing interest of
society in the untrammeled dissemination of ideas.  It is this
striking of balances in the law of copyright in the past, at
present, and for the future, which constitutes the central
theme of the James Carpentier Lectures delivered by
Professor Benjamin Kaplan at the Columbia University School
of Law in March, 1966.

Book Availability and the Library User
.A
Guyton, T.L.
.W
  The essentially logistical problem of making library books physically
available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship.  This
book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such
it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of
solutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical
analysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding
of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  The
fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the
insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to
a better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved library
services.

Universal Bibliographic Control
.A
Anderson, D.
.W
  IFLA will be nearly fifty years old when Dorothy Anderson's UBC paper is
published.  It is tempting to say that it is a half a century overdue.  When
librarians first began to look beyond their national borders, bibliographic
control was in the forefront of their concern.  Gradually, however, these
pioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical
problems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions
the emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations, on the social
and even economic achievements of the international library community -
which was not fully international at all - were limited to comparisons of
national efforts, with some countries constantly over-critical and others 
overgenerous.  Outstanding bibliographic projects, like the Gesamtkatalog der 
Wiegendrucke, were international in scope, but national in conception.

The Universal Decimal Classification
.A
Foskett, A.C.
.W
  This study represents the result of some fifteen years of contact with
the Universal Decimal Classification, as a user, as a reviser and as a
classification teacher.  As a Information Officer at the Atomic Energy
Research Establishment, Harwell, I was concerned with the use of the
Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), both as classifier and as user
of the resulting catalogues; I was also directly concerned as Liaison
Officer for the Atomic Energy Research committee for UDC with the
development of the Code of Practice which later became the basis of the
Special subject edition for nuclear science and engineering.  With
accelerators; this work was carried out along the general lines indicated
in this study, and is now part of UDC, which indicates that modern ideas
can be accommodated within the scheme without undue strain.

Universals in Linguistic Theory
.A
Fillmore, C.J.
.W
  We feel that a profound change has occurred in linguistic thinking
in the last decade.  It is not longer of any interest to describe
one after another language 'anyhow' without regard to the relevance
of the facts to general linguistic theory.  As Ross put it, it makes
no sense to talk about 'describing a language in terms of its own
structure alone.'  Toward the end of the conference, when it had become
apparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currently
explicitly formulated model, the question was raised:  What should we
be teaching our students?  Langendoen's answer seems to us most apt:
We should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguistic
problem when they see one, that is, one which throws some light -
negative or positive - on our conceptions of what languages in general
are like.

The Case of Citation Data in Writing the History of Science
.A
Garfield, E.
.W
  Can a computer write the history of science?  Probably not in the sense
usually implied.  However, the research reported herein is a preliminary
attempt to understand and define some basic problems that must be solved 
if computers are ever to aid the historian of science - no less supplant him.
In this study, it was necessary to select a recent important scientific
breakthrough which was based on the cumulation of years of diverse
scientific achievement.  For this reason we selected the discovery of the
DNA code.  For a concise historical description of the events, we then
selected "The Genetic Code," a book by Dr. Isaac Asimov which describes
the major scientific developments that eventually led to the duplication
in the laboratory of the process of protein synthesis under control of DNA.

User Requirements in Identifying Desired Works in Large Libraries
.A
Lipetz, B.A.
.W
    The work reported here is a study of the utilization of the card
catalog of a very large library, specifically the principal catalog of
the library system of Yale University.
    The study was motivated by two basic concerns, one of them of a
long-term, or exploratory, nature, the other of a short-term, or
operationally supportive, nature.  The long-term concern is the question
of how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library that
can be expected to give the best possible performance.  The short-term
concern is the question of whether, and, of so, how, existing card
catalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to user
requirements.  It was recognized that a carefully designed study of actual
utilization of a catalog of a large library could shed useful light in
both areas of concern.

Vocabulary Control for Information Retrieval
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
  This book deals with properties of vocabularies for
indexing and searching document collections; the
construction, organization, display, and maintenance
of these vocabularies; and the vocabulary as a factor
affecting the performance of retrieval systems.  Most
of the text is concerned with vocabularies for post-
coordinate retrieval systems, with special emphasis
on thesauri and machine-based systems.  Vocabularies
for pre-coordinate systems (e.g., alphabetical subject
catalogs and classified catalogs) are discussed only
briefly to provide historical perspective and for the
light they shed on the problems o vocabulary control in
general.  This type of vocabulary is well covered in
existing texts.

The Weapons Acquisitition Process: An Economic Analysis
.A
Peck, M.J.
.W
  A distinctive feature of American weapons development and
production is the use of private firms to carry forward most of the
effort.  This volume is primarily concerned with the government-
business relationships within which these activities take place.
Our title reflects our emphasis.  Weapons Acquisition is defined to
include the conception, development, and production of technically
advanced weapons for ultimate use by the armed forces.  Process
emphasizes the flow of decisions and activities during weapons
programs, including the actions, reactions, and interactions of
government agencies and defense contractors.  Economic Analysis indicates
our concern with how these activities and relationships affect the
quality, time, cost, and value outcomes of weapons programs.
  The principal objective of this volume is increased knowledge of
these facets of weapons development and production.  Such an
objective classified the volume as a social science, rather than
administrative study.  Yet most social science research, 
however "pure" the form, is ultimately directed at changing public
policy.  That is the intention here, but this book does not conclude with a
specific set of public policy recommendations.  Rather, it is largely limited
to providing understanding - a prerequisite to criticism, debate, revision,
and improvement.

Weeding Library Collections
.A
Slote, S.J.
.W
    This book is based upon two recent research projects in weeding and
identifying core collections.  However, it became apparent that the principles
and techniques studied are applicable to almost all types of library 
collections.
    This work has been designed to be used for four distinct purposes:
    1. As a comprehensive source summarizing the opinion, knowledge, and
serious research in the field of weeding.  The author's own research is 
reported in such detail that replication of the studies is possible.  In
addition, this book contains the first report of the Harrison study.
    2. As a do-it-yourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out their
present collections.  It is the aim of this book not only to explain and
justify its methods, but to include a step-by-step procedure for "weeding
without tears."
    3. As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal with
the acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is one 
of the best techniques available for the long-range building of useful 
collections.
    4. As a stimulus to further study in this entire area.  It is hoped that
libraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costs
of weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount of
circulation and in user satisfaction.

Some Behavioral Patterns of Library Users:  The 80/20 rule
.A
Trueswell, R.L. 
.W
  A characteristic of inventory in business or industry
is that approximately 80 percent of the number of
transactions taken from a warehouse represents about
20 percent of the items stocked.  This may also be
considered as a ranking of stock items by their
transaction activity which will show that the top 20
percent of the stocked items (i.e., the most active
items) account for about 80 percent of the total
number of transactions.  The rule is sometimes
expressed as the 75/25 rule with the same interpretation.
It is only by coincidence that the figures add to 100
as the phenomena relate to the relationships between
the two statistical measures.

The Wiswesser Line-Formula Chemical Notation (WLN)
.A
Smith, E.G.
.W
    The line-formula chemical notation described in this manual
is a precise and concise means of expressing the structural
formulas of chemical compounds.  Its basic idea is to use
letter symbols to denote functional groups and to use numbers
to express the lengths of alkyl chains and the sizes of rings.
These symbols then are cited in connecting order from one end of
the molecule to the other.  For the past hundred years, ever
since structural chemistry began, chemists have been using graphic
symbols in this way.  This line-formula notation is simply an
extension and standardization of this practice.

Women in Librarianship

Myers, M.

  There are some who question whether the status of women in the
library profession is a major issue.  A survey of library literature,
however shows an increase in the factual data available regarding
differences between men and women in salaries, promotional patterns
and other professional situations. There are local library groups
which are examining the status of women in their own libraries and
organizing to improve their employment situations.  On the state
and national level, conference programs and workshops at library
association meetings have dealt with various aspects of sex
discrimination, affirmative action policies, sexism in children's
materials and the like.

Work and Motivation
.A
Vroom, V.H.
.W
  The basic plan for this book was evolved during the summer of 1959.
At that time I was working on a chapter entitled "Industrial Social
Psychology" for the annual Review of Psychology.  I was impressed by
the large amount of research being conducted in the field, but found
the task of integrating that research and of identifying the progress
made during the period of the review exceedingly difficult.  In part,
this difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigators
in the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they used
to study it.  A more troublesome problem, however, was the apparent
theoretical implications of their research.  Concepts tended to be
highly specific and inadequately defined.  There was little standardization
of terminology and little consideration for the nature of the processes
underlying empirical data.

Work and the Nature of Man
.A
Herzberg, F.
.W
  Work and the Nature of Man is the third book of a
trilogy concerning job attitudes.  In the first book,
Job Attitudes: Review of Research and Opinion, my
colleagues and I attempted to review and systematize
what had been gleaned from research and contemplation
after a half-century of effort.  In the Motivation to
Work that followed, we described an original research
study that offered a completely new hypothesis about the
way people feel about their jobs.  In this book, I have
taken that hypothesis and expanded it to a general theory
of Work and the Nature of Man.	While the trilogy contains
the three basic stages of scientific inquiry, knowledge
of what has gone before, new research and finally a
theory, the task that I set out for myself many years
ago, upon graduation for the School of Public Health
at the University of Pittsburgh, is just beginning.  
That task was to give original substance to the new 
discipline of Industrial Mental Health and, if possible,
to make some positive contributions.

World Dynamics
.A
Forrester, J.W.
.W
  Over the last several decades interest in economic development,
population growth, and the world environment has expanded rapidly.
As world-wide stresses have increased, many individuals and 
organizations have begun to study and to influence the changing
aspects of the world situation.  But it seems fair to observe
that most of the activity has been addressed to separate facets
of the world system.  Little has yet been done to show how the many
actions and forces are affecting one another to produce the total
consequences that we observe.  Now however, many persons are coming
to believe that the interactions within the whole are more important
than the sum of the separate parts.  This book was undertaken as one
step toward showing how the behavior of the world system results from
mutual interplay between its demographic, industrial, and agricultural
subsystems.

World Trends in Library Education
.A
Bramley, G.
.W
  One of the most significant aspects of the evolution of
librarianship in the twentieth century has been the emergence 
of the library schools as a potent factor in shaping new
philosophies and new attitudes in the library profession.  The
intention of the present work is to examine some of the
implications of this rapid growth in the number of library
schools, noting current trends and possible changes in the
future.  Inevitably, some limitations have had to be imposed,
and there has been a deliberate concentration upon Anglo-
American library education, while at the same time examining
other major patterns of professional education for librarians
which exist in the world, and comparing these with the
approach  of the English speaking countries.  An attempt has
been made to trace the influences which the British and
America systems of library education have had, particularly
in the developing countries.

Legal Restrictions on Exploitation of the Patent Monopoly:
An Economic Analysis
.A
Baxter, W.A.
.W
  The patent laws confer on a patentee power to exclude all others
from making, using or selling his invention.  In furtherance of a
constitutionally recognized goal - "To promote the Progress of
Science and the useful Arts" - Congress has thus adopted a 
constitutionally authorized means - "securing...to Inventors
the exclusive Right to their respective...Discoveries."  The
constitutional clause is remarkable in several respects.  Its
recognition of the possibility that invention might require
encouragement implies not only that technological innovation is
desirable but also that, but for legal subsidization, the quantity
of innovation forthcoming would or might be less than optimum.
This recognition, coming on the morn of an era during which the
tendency of a free market to achieve optimality in all activities
was greatly and religiously overestimated, prompts brief inquiry
into the soundness of the supposition.

This book considers the basic aspects of this complex problem - the historical
and social essence of language and thought, their interaction in historical
evolution, the essence of linguistic meaning in relation to the content side
of thought, and the physiological mechanism of the processes of abstraction,
generalization, etc.

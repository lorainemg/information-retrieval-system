# Information Retrieval System

This repository implements an Information Retrieval System based on the Vector Information Retrieval Model. It includes a visual interface powered by `Streamlit` and provides evaluation using various objective metrics across different test collections.

## Features

- Implements Vector Information Retrieval Model
- Visual interface using Streamlit
- Evaluation with different test collections and objective metrics
- Clustering techniques to group documents
- Implementation of a crawler to gain information.
- NLP techniques and different metrics in different collections are applied to check the functionality of the system.
